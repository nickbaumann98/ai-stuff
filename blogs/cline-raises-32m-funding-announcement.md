# Cline raises $32M to build the future of open source AI coding

When I first experienced Claude 3.5 Sonnet during Anthropic's hackathon in July 2024, something clicked. It wasn't just another powerful model. For the first time, an LLM could think and navigate complexity in ways that felt genuinely human. I spent that weekend in my mom's garage in Terre Haute, experimenting with a simple idea: what would happen if I gave an AI model the same tools I use? File access, command execution, the ability to navigate a codebase like a developer would.

The demo didn't win, but that wasn't the point. The point was that this technology needed to be in developers' hands.

This wasn't my first time learning what developers really need. A few years back, I built a git-based paywall for open source projects. I spent two years convinced I was solving a real problem. When I launched, the community's response was swift: they hated it. Not because they didn't want to support open source, but because I'd violated something fundamental. Developers need to see what's happening. They need transparency, especially when AI is touching their code.

That lesson became Cline's foundation. Every prompt is visible. Every file read is logged. Every edit is shown before it's made. You bring your own API keys. When you spend $100 on Claude 4 Sonnet or Gemini 2.5 Pro, you get $100 worth of intelligence, not a fraction of it padded with cheaper models to protect someone's margins.

This transparency created something unexpected. Developers started having what they called their "AGI moment" with Cline. Taking their hands off the keyboard and watching Cline tackle complex refactoring, build entire features, debug issues they'd been stuck on for hours. Over 2 million developers have now experienced this.

In February, we put up a basic enterprise page on cline.bot with a Calendly link. We figured some companies might be interested. What happened next caught us off guard. Fortune 100 companies started booking calls. Others just reached out directly to support@cline.bot. Over one weekend, 300 developers from a single tech giant signed up for Cline accounts. Samsung publicly announced their internal deployment. Big tech companies were maintaining internal forks.

The message was clear: enterprises wanted what individual developers already had. Direct access to the best models. Complete visibility into AI operations. The ability to use their own infrastructure and API keys.

Which brings us here. After moving to San Francisco to build a team around what started in that garage, we're announcing $32M in funding led by Emergence Capital with participation from Pace Capital, 1984 Ventures, and key developer-focused angels. We're also launching Cline Teams to meet the enterprise demand that found us.

We raised this capital for one reason: to build the infrastructure these enterprises need while keeping Cline open source. It's not about changing direction. It's about scaling what's already working. And that foundation, the open source commitment that got us here, that stays unchanged. Always.

The funding changes nothing about our core philosophy. We're not becoming another AI coding tool that locks you into one model or ecosystem. As models improve, Cline improves with them. When Claude 4 launched, Cline users got it immediately. When Gemini offered better context windows, our users could switch instantly. This model agnosticism isn't just a feature. It's the future.

We're also expanding beyond VS Code. Open source JetBrains extensions and terminal-native Cline are coming in the next few weeks. We see a future where Cline works wherever developers work. Open source, open model, open platform.

The developers who've been pushing Cline to its limits, the ones spending serious money on frontier models because the productivity gains are worth it, you built this. Every PR, every Discord discussion, every piece of feedback shaped what Cline has become. This funding is about scaling what you've already validated: that developers deserve direct, transparent access to the most powerful AI available.

Thank you to everyone who made this possible. The early adopters who took a chance on a weekend project. The contributors who turned ideas into code. The community that pushed us to think bigger. And the team that's turning this vision into reality. We're just getting started.
