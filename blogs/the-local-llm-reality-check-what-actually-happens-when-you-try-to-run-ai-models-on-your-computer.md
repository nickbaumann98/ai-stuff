If you've used DeepSeek's R1 (or V3 for that matter), you've probably been impressed at its performance for the price. And if you've run into issues with its API recently, your next thought was probably, *“Hey, I’ve got a decent computer—maybe I can run this locally and run this myself!”*

Then reality hits: **the full DeepSeek R1 model needs about 1,342 GB of VRAM**—no, that’s not a typo. It’s designed to run on a cluster of 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each with 80GB of memory ([source](https://apxml.com/posts/gpu-requirements-deepseek-r1?ref=cline.ghost.io)). Let’s break down what this means and what you can *actually* run on your computer.

## Understanding the Scale: Why These Models Are Different

DeepSeek R1 is massive:

* **671 billion** total parameters
* **37 billion** active parameters per operation
* **1,342 GB** of VRAM required for the *full* version
* Typically run on **16 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs**
  ([source](https://apxml.com/posts/gpu-requirements-deepseek-r1?ref=cline.ghost.io))

When you’re editing 4K video or running multiple virtual machines, your system is doing exactly what it was designed to do. Running an AI model of this size, however, is closer to installing a data center in your home office.

## Real Performance Numbers

Even though it’s huge, DeepSeek R1 achieves remarkable speeds and accuracy:

* **56.8 tokens/second** generation speed
* **21.39 seconds** for the first token
* **128–130k** token context window
  ([source](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/deepseek-r1?ref=cline.ghost.io),
  [compare data](https://docsbot.ai/models/compare/deepseek-r1/gpt-3-5-turbo?ref=cline.ghost.io))

These numbers are excellent in a cloud or distributed environment. Locally, though, the story changes drastically:

1. Your computer will be *heavily* loaded.
2. Responses can be *5–10× slower* than on dedicated servers.
3. Long sessions may cause system instability.

## What You *Can* Actually Run: Distilled Variants

Running the *full* 671B-parameter DeepSeek R1 at home is out of reach for most of us. However, DeepSeek also provides **distilled** versions with far fewer parameters, making local deployment more realistic
([source](https://apxml.com/posts/gpu-requirements-deepseek-r1?ref=cline.ghost.io)):

* **1.5B version**: ~0.7 GB VRAM *(RTX 3060 12GB or higher)*
* **7B version**: ~3.3 GB VRAM *(RTX 3070 8GB or higher)*
* **14B version**: ~6.5 GB VRAM *(RTX 3080 10GB or higher)*
* **32B version**: ~14.9 GB VRAM *(RTX 4090 24GB)*
* **70B version**: ~32.7 GB VRAM *(requires two 24GB GPUs, e.g. dual RTX 4090s)*

Recent community benchmarks suggest the following real-world insights
([discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i69dhz/deepseek_r1_ollama_hardware_benchmark_for_localllm/?ref=cline.ghost.io)):

* **14B Model**:
  + Can run on “any modern GPU” (like RTX 3080 or above)
  + Often does *not* show major performance gaps with the right quantization
* **32B Model**:
  + Best suited for a single GPU with ~24GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 4090)
* **70B Model**:
  + Ideally requires two GPUs (e.g., dual RTX 3090 or dual RTX 4090)
  + Significantly higher power and cooling needs

## Local Deployment Reality Check

Even if you stick to the smaller variants, be aware of these practical limitations:

1. **Memory Requirements**
   * Most consumer PCs have 16–32 GB of system RAM. Even the distilled models thrive with more memory and fast SSDs.
   * Using swap on an SSD to compensate for VRAM is painfully slow.
2. **System Stability**
   * Extended inference sessions can cause system slowdown.
   * Other apps (games, video editing) may become borderline unusable while the model is running.
3. **The models will not perform as well**
   * Even the highest rated of the [local R1 variants](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF?ref=cline.ghost.io) struggle to perform compared to using the full version.
   * Using Cline you will find that it's less capable of tool-calling, which is a critical function of the extension.

For the *full* DeepSeek R1, you’ll need:

* Distributed GPUs or a setup with **400+ GB** of combined VRAM/RAM
* High-core-count CPU
* Robust cooling and power supply
  ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1iblms1/running_deepseek_r1_locally_is_not_possible/?ref=cline.ghost.io))

## Popular Ways to Run These Models

### 1. Using Ollama

A common command-line tool for local inference:

```
ollama run deepseek-r1-7b

```

* Takes minutes to load the model
* Uses all available GPU/CPU resources
* Slower than cloud-based solutions
  ([guide](https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/a-step-by-step-guide-to-install-deepseek-r1-locally-with-ollama-vllm-or-transformers-44a1?ref=cline.ghost.io))

### 2. Using LM Studio

A more user-friendly GUI-based approach:

* **Easier Setup**
  + Less fuss with environment variables and dependencies
* **Limitations**
  + Still resource-intensive
  + Long conversations or large context windows can cause memory issues

## The Reality Check

1. **You Cannot Run the Full 671B Model on a Typical Home PC**
   * It needs specialized hardware (multi-GPU systems with massive VRAM).
2. **Distilled Models Are Plausible, but Lower-Performing**
   * Even so, a powerful GPU (e.g., RTX 3080 or better) is recommended.
3. **Plan for Slower Speeds and Higher Power Draw**
   * Especially for 32B and 70B models.

## Conclusion: Tailor Your Approach

Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or enthusiast:

* **Start Small**
  + Try 1.5B or 7B versions to see what your hardware can handle.
* **Quantize Models**
  + Use 4-bit or 8-bit quantization if available, which reduces VRAM usage.
* **Hybrid Solutions**
  + Use local models for privacy or small tasks, and fall back to the cloud for bigger jobs.
* **Stay Skeptical of Overblown Claims**
  + Benchmarks matter more than marketing headlines.
