# AWS & Cline: 35 New MCP Servers to Manage Your Cloud with AI

The gap between AI-assisted development and comprehensive cloud management just got significantly smaller. We're excited to announce that Amazon Web Services has officially contributed 35 new Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to the Cline ecosystem. This is a major milestone that extends the power of AI to nearly every corner of the AWS platform, allowing developers to manage their entire cloud infrastructure using natural language.

For a long time, managing a complex cloud environment meant juggling dozens of consoles, dashboards, and configuration files. With these new MCP servers, that complexity can be abstracted away. Instead of learning the intricacies of each service's interface, you can now simply state your intent to an AI assistant like Cline, and have it translate your request into the necessary actions.

## What This Means for Developers

This new suite of MCP servers covers the full spectrum of AWS services. Whether you're working with databases, serverless functions, or Kubernetes clusters, there's now a direct line of communication between your AI assistant and your cloud resources.

Hereâ€™s a look at what you can now manage directly through natural language.

## The Power of an Open Standard

This contribution from AWS is also a powerful validation of the Model Context Protocol. When we first integrated MCP, we saw its potential to become a universal standard for how AI interacts with tools. Seeing a major cloud provider like AWS embrace it so comprehensively confirms that vision.

Because MCP is an open standard, these new servers benefit the entire developer community. Any MCP-compatible tool can now leverage these new capabilities, fostering a more interconnected and powerful AI development ecosystem.
