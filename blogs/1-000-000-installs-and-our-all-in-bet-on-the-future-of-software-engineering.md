From the jump, we've envisioned a bolder path forward in AI coding. While others perfect tab autocomplete, we've been building a truly collaborative coding agent that transforms how software gets created.

From day one, we've given engineers full, unrestricted access to frontier models—exactly as they were designed to be used. No context limitations, no artificial constraints to fit subscription economics. This is AI coding in its purest form.

What does this mean in practice? Cline reads entire files, actively seeks additional context by exploring related files, and asks clarifying questions when needed. It's like driving a Ferrari in fifth gear instead of first—more comprehensive context means better code, faster development, and ultimately, a better return on your investment.

This commitment to leading rather than following extends beyond our core product. We integrated MCP when the ink was barely dry on the protocol, and we launched the first marketplace for one-click MCP installation while others were still months behind.

Our approach is anchored in being open source—a decision that has been fundamental to our success. It's enabled rapid innovation, community contributions, and created unprecedented transparency in an industry often defined by black boxes. This openness has fueled an insanely enthusiastic community that has driven our growth through word of mouth because they experience the difference firsthand.

The impact is reaching far beyond individual developers. Fortune 100 companies are now reaching out to implement Cline across their engineering teams—they recognize that this approach to AI coding isn't just incrementally better, it's transformatively different.

Looking forward, we remain all-in on the agentic, collaborative approach to coding. No bifurcations, no complications—just a pure focus on creating the most powerful coding agent possible while keeping humans in the loop. And because we're model-agnostic by design, as models improve, Cline improves with them immediately.

Our bet is clear: inference costs will continue to drop, making our approach of prioritizing quality and capability over artificial constraints even more valuable. Why shortchange yourself on the greatest leverage technology has ever offered developers?

The implications extend beyond individual productivity. This isn't just about convenience—it's about being part of a fundamental economic shift. When engineers become 5x more productive and coding becomes accessible to more people, we unlock trillions in economic value. And 5x is just the starting point—this multiplier will grow exponentially as we continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

One million installs is a milestone at the bottom of an exponential growth curve. We don't know exactly what autonomous coding will look like in 1-5 years, but we're certain of one thing: we'll be defining it, not following it.

The next chapter of software engineering is being written right now, and we are holding the pen.
