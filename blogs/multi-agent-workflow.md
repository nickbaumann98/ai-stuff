# From One to Many: How Power Users Scale Development with Multiple AI Agents

A single, conversational AI agent is a powerful assistant. You give it a task, it works on it, and you get a result. This is a great model for simple, linear problems. But modern software development is rarely simple or linear. Itâ€™s a complex, multi-threaded process of managing different services, contexts, and priorities all at once.

I was talking to a developer the other day who works on a loyalty gaming rewards platform with 4.5 million users. His reality isn't a single task in a single repo. It's a web of microservices for fraud, rewards, and in-app shops, alongside a Kotlin Android app, Go-based APIs, and a few side clients. To manage this, he doesn't just use one AI agent; he often has three or four running simultaneously.

This isn't about just opening more terminal tabs. It's a deliberate strategy for parallelizing development. While one agent is scaffolding a new feature in a NestJS backend, another might be working on updating a corresponding service, and a third could be referencing documentation to help write automated tests. This approach mirrors how a human team works -- different members tackling different parts of a project in parallel.

### The Context Switching Problem

The immediate challenge with this workflow is managing context. How do you keep each agent on track? How do you, the developer, keep track of what each agent is doing? If you step away for a few hours to focus on one project, the context for the others can go stale. You return to a blinking cursor, faced with the mental overhead of remembering exactly where you left off.

This is where the workflow gets interesting. This developer doesn't just rely on the agent's built-in short-term memory. He's built a personal, persistent memory system using a `Qdrant` vector database, exposed to his agents through a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

Before he switches tasks, he can tell an agent to store the current state of its work -- the nuances of the code, the plan, the last few steps -- as an embedding in his `Qdrant` instance. When he returns to that project, hours or even days later, the agent can query the database and instantly recall the entire context. It knows what it was working on, what the goals were, and what the next step is. The cognitive load of context switching is offloaded from the developer to the system.

### Building Your Own Multi-Agent System

This level of orchestration might sound complex, but it points to a fundamental shift in how we can approach development. The goal is to build a personalized environment that adapts to your specific needs. The foundation for this is an open ecosystem that allows you to create and connect your own tools, just as this user did with his `Qdrant` server.

You don't need to start with four agents and a vector database. Start small.

1.  **Try Two Agents:** On your next project, try running two agents in parallel. Assign one a core coding task and the other a research or documentation task. See how it feels to offload a secondary task.
2.  **Think About Memory:** Consider the repetitive context you provide to your agent. Is it the structure of your API? Your team's testing conventions? This information could be stored in a simple text file and fed to the agent via a custom tool, forming the basis of a simple memory system.
3.  **Explore Custom Tools:** The real power comes from connecting agents to your unique workflow. Whether it's managing feature flags in Statsig, creating tickets in Linear, or querying a custom database, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows you to build these connections.

The future of AI-augmented development isn't just about having a single, smarter assistant. It's about orchestrating a team of specialized agents that work for you, managed by you, and tailored to your exact workflow.

If you're experimenting with multi-agent setups or have built custom MCPs to solve your own workflow challenges, we'd love to see them. Share your experiences and what you've built on our Discord (`https://discord.gg/cline`) or on Reddit (`https://www.reddit.com/r/cline/`).
