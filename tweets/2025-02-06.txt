4/6 Memory Bank uses these diagrams to solve a common AI problem: Every new chat = complete memory reset. Instead of re-explaining your project each time, Memory Bank gives Cline a structured way to rebuild context.

--------------------

5/6 Want to experiment with this? Add Mermaid diagrams to your Cline custom instructions. The process is simple -- take your current custom instructions and have AI convert it to a Mermaid diagram.

Writing walls of text to tell an AI what to do is painful. Our community discovered something interesting: using Mermaid diagram code for custom instructions instead of paragraphs. Here's what it looks like in practice ðŸ§µ https://t.co/LbLBixQcit
