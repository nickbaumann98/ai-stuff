Setup is simple:
- Install Claude Code following Anthropic's guide
- In Cline: Settings > API Configuration > Select "Claude Code"
- Set the path to your path to Claude Code CLI (usually just "claude")

That's it. You're now using your Max subscription instead of paying per token.

How it works: When you select Claude Code as your provider, Cline connects to Claude through the CLI. Your Max subscription covers all the AI usage - you'll see $0.00 costs in Cline's billing.
