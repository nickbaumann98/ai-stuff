Claude Max subscribers: you can use your subscription in Cline instead of pay-per-token.

Settings → API Configuration → select "Claude Code" → add your Claude CLI path

↓

Find your Claude CLI path:
- Mac/Linux: which claude
- Windows CMD: where claude  
- Windows PowerShell: Get-Command claude

↓

How it works:
- Cline runs the Claude CLI in the background
- You get Claude's AI + Cline's tools
- Max subscribers see $0.00 costs

Use what you're already paying for.
