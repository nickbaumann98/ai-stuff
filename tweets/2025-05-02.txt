4. Git Tools: Interact with Git repos using commands like status, diff, commit, branch management, and more. Automate common Git tasks programmatically. https://t.co/o7zJ4mL8dM

--------------------

This deep understanding is kept efficient: - Minimal context loading pulls only necessary info via the dependency map. - New caching &amp; batch processing deliver a ~95% speedup in analysis (~11 mins -&gt; ~30 secs). Keeps token use low and development fast, even on huge codebases. https://t.co/VkIUN42srM

--------------------

How? v7.7 introduces **Contextual Keys (KeyInfo)** and **Hierarchical Dependency Aggregation**. This isn't just linking files; it's mapping the *meaningful relationships* between modules, docs, and code, creating a rich, queryable knowledge graph of your project. https://t.co/i4fUIbooCR

--------------------

Integrating domain-specific tools is also happening. We've seen ideas like the Deebo MCP for debugging, plus interest in controlling Unity, Blender, Figma, databases, etc., directly from Cline. Keeps the workflow focused in one place. https://t.co/1vuv3ksIZC

--------------------

Which MCP Servers are missing from this list? ðŸ‘‡

--------------------

Take "Vibe MCp" -- a tool that generates music from your code context. Fun, maybe impractical, but definitely creative. Our own, @trevhud, who hadn't coded much in years, built it in a weekend using Cline.

--------------------

What if building any software idea, even impractical ones, was suddenly fast enough to be feasible? Cline's speed makes it possible, lowering the barrier to entry and unlocking creativity alongside productivity.

--------------------

(We've also seen MCPs like 21st Dev's Magic UI used to generate UI components directly!) https://t.co/rM7jZP1omL

--------------------

Itâ€™s cool seeing the community drive Cline's capabilities like this. What specific tool would be most useful to control via an MCP? Or have you built one we should know about?

--------------------

And now you can visualize these connections! The new (experimental) visualize-dependencies command generates Mermaid flowcharts of the project's dependency structure.

--------------------

Here's the referenced Reddit post: https://t.co/vlG1NovACD

--------------------

Honorable Mentions: Also seeing lots of use are Context7 (AI-friendly docs), Perplexity (AI research), Magic UI by 21st Dev (UI generation), and Supabase (backend integration)!

--------------------

2. Browser Tools: Monitor browser activity, capture screenshots, analyze logs &amp; interact with the DOM via its Chrome extension. Great for debugging web apps visually. https://t.co/NIKZ0FELXu

--------------------

Secure AI adoption isn't about restriction, it's about sponsorship. Providing enterprise-ready tools like Cline gives teams powerful AI capabilities (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7, etc.) while keeping data handling secure via BYOK, VPCs, and auditability.

--------------------

Wow. A Cline user has evolved their Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought (CRCT) system for Cline with v7.7. This is like Memory Bank on steroids. The advanced context management for large codebases just got even better. ðŸ§µ https://t.co/lmjYMACPnJ

--------------------

9. Puppeteer: Automate browser actions using Puppeteer. Interact with pages, take screenshots, and execute JavaScript in a real browser environment for testing or automation. https://t.co/4SRTGuUK78

--------------------

Vibe MCp repo: https://t.co/5RHePlb8wN

--------------------

How? Cline abstracts away much of the frustrating syntax wrestling and setup time. It lets you focus more on the core idea, experimenting with APIs, and actually building, making the process faster and more enjoyable.

--------------------

1. GitHub: Manage repos, files, issues &amp; PRs directly using Cline. Essential for integrating version control workflows seamlessly into your development process. https://t.co/Mfl6oxUUS2

--------------------

5. Sequential Thinking: Tackle complex problems methodically. This MCP enables structured, step-by-step reasoning, breaking down intricate tasks into manageable parts for more robust solutions. https://t.co/KD4Tmx75JK

--------------------

7. FireCrawl: Advanced web scraping &amp; crawling *for context*. Handles JS rendering, batch jobs, extracts structured data, and can perform deep research across multiple pages. https://t.co/1LUKcKKidE

--------------------

Web automation via MCPs (like Magnitude &amp; @hyperbrowser MCP) is another key area. Common uses include automating browser tests, scraping data needed for a feature, or handling repetitive web tasks -- all without leaving the editor. Saves a ton of manual effort. https://t.co/OsK8SnfpB2

--------------------

We're seeing developers use MCP servers in Cline to build some seriously useful custom workflows -- extending Cline far beyond its core features. Here's a look at how the community is using them: ðŸ§µ https://t.co/EX4Vpkhs3P

--------------------

3. File System: Allows Cline to programmatically access detailed file metadata. Use get_file_info to retrieve size, modification times, permissions, and type (file/directory) for scripting or analysis. https://t.co/gohUlDoxeJ

--------------------

The challenge with AI on big projects: context limits mean constantly re-explaining the codebase. CRCT v7.7 solves this not just with memory, but by building a deep, persistent *understanding* of your project's structure and dependencies. https://t.co/x5z0nPEhSN

--------------------

We recently saw a case where using a public LLM led to subtle errors and leaked sensitive IP. Without sanctioned tools, engineers naturally turn to what's available, creating technical, legal, and competitive vulnerabilities. This 'shadow AI' usage bypasses security perimeters.

--------------------

What this means for developers: Cline, powered by CRCT v7.7, can maintain a sophisticated understanding of massive codebases across sessions. Less re-explaining, more building complex features accurately.

--------------------

This speed makes more ideas economically viable, even the experimental ones. It's not just about 5x productivity, it's about enabling the previously unthinkable. What "impractical" idea would you build?

--------------------

10. Playwright: Another powerful browser automation server using Playwright. Enables interaction, screenshots, and JS execution for robust cross-browser testing and automation. https://t.co/KRHNQyEDl9

--------------------

Incredible innovation from the community. Huge respect to @DemonSynth for this innovation in AI-assisted development. Explore CRCT v7.7 on GitHub: https://t.co/AJ7q5P9tjJ

--------------------

8. Browser Use: Control web browsers using natural language. Navigate pages, fill forms, understand visuals -- useful for automating complex web interactions. https://t.co/zKjGfKrqih

--------------------

A big one is augmenting context with RAG. Instead of just relying on the model's knowledge, developers connect Cline to docs, APIs, or knowledge bases using servers like @upstash Context7 or Perplexity-mcp. This leads to more relevant code, faster. https://t.co/kIJ0EmjQ6b

--------------------

Empower your teams safely. The most effective way to prevent shadow AI is to provide better, secure alternatives that integrate into their workflow. Read more on building a robust AI strategy: https://t.co/noZoedCIhx

6. Fetch: Pull web content (HTML, JSON, text, Markdown) directly *as context* for Cline. Useful for quickly grounding Cline with information from specific URLs. https://t.co/vGP6KD40np

--------------------

Your engineers are already using AI. The real question is whether it's happening securely within your control, or through risky 'shadow AI' channels using personal accounts and public interfaces. ðŸ§µ

--------------------

Read Trevor's story: https://t.co/gbYQsKp0yH

--------------------

The system uses main trackers (module relationships, docs) and module-specific mini-trackers. v7.7 enhances this with commands like show-dependencies to easily inspect connections across all trackers for any part of your code.

--------------------

It operates in distinct phases (Setup/Maintenance, Strategy, Execution, and the new Cleanup/Consolidation), controlled via .clinerules, ensuring a structured approach throughout development. https://t.co/6saai2Ro8D
