v0 1.5 models are now available in Cline. These are models from v0 that are specialized in frontend code generation for React and Next.js.

Here's what makes them different and how to set them up:
↓
Unlike general-purpose models, v0 1.5 was built specifically for web development.

It combines a frontier base model with custom AutoFix that catches errors during generation, plus Quick Edit for fast inline changes.
↓
The results speak for themselves:

- v0-1.5-md: 93.87% error-free generation
- Claude 4 Sonnet: 64.71% 
- GPT-4.1: 58.82%
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: 58.82%

That's a massive difference for frontend work.
