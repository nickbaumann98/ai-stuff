Maybe apply a few more precautions when you use Cline ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/VAq921WZ7c

--------------------

FYI, you can use DeepSeek R1 (deepseek/deepseek-r1:free) and V3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat:free) for free in Cline. These models deliver performance close to Claude Sonnet 3.5/3.7 but at a fraction of the costâ€”or in this case, completely free. Just a heads-up: performance may slow https://t.co/BCXK3O6Zl1

--------------------

@donvito Hope they're using deepseek

5/ And the implementation is dead simple: 1. Paste our custom instructions into Cline settings 2. Ask Cline to "initialize memory bank" That's it. Cline now maintains perfect project documentation without you doing a thing.

--------------------

Developers using Cline are firing themselves as programmers and becoming software architects instead. The shift is wild -- they're orchestrating rather than coding. Instead of drowning in implementation details, they focus on what actually matters. This isn't about https://t.co/CW811EA4Lc

--------------------

3/ The genius is in the implementation: 4/ Cline uses Mermaid diagrams as instructions â€“ not just text prompts. This visual workflow language is unambiguous, giving AI a precise map instead of vague directions. This structured approach eliminates hallucination at its source. https://t.co/c5jd2A2Zww

Building MCP servers requires structure. Start with a .clinerules (linked below) file in your project root to guide development through planning, implementation, and testing. This enforced methodology helps create servers that actually work when deployed ðŸ§µ

--------------------

4/ We're essentially teaching AI to manage its own memory limits by creating external documentation it can refer back to. It's like a detective leaving perfect notes for its future self. No more "I think I remember that" â€“ just factual context.

6/ Stop repeating yourself to AI. Stop watching it hallucinate solutions. Start letting it document itself. Try Cline's Memory Bank system today and see why it's transforming how developers work with AI. https://t.co/ER45ItGWk8

--------------------

Dario's prediction about AI writing 100% of code in 12 months? From a technical standpoint, we've shown that's absolutely achievable. The real hurdles aren't technical but organizational. Individual devs can adopt AI coding tools overnight, but companies face security,

1/ Memory is AI's biggest limitation. Every new session means re-explaining your entire project architecture. Cline's Memory Bank transforms this weakness into a strength by building a self-documenting system that persists between sessions.

--------------------

2/ How it works: 1. Cline creates a structured memory-bank/ folder 2. It automatically documents key aspects: project brief, tech context, system patterns 3. Before any work, it reads these files to rebuild context 4. After significant changes, it updates the documentation https://t.co/TbsGZKtL6S

Context is the antidote to hallucination. These auto-generated docs prevent Cline from making things up by giving it a memory. The best part? Cline creates and updates these docs itself, then refers back to them when needed. Here's how you can use Memory Bank ðŸ§µ https://t.co/QWtKYtDGXd
