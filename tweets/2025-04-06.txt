Fewer interruptions from diff errors. Cline now intelligently detects when you manually edit a file and re-reads it before making changes. This means fewer diff edit errors.

--------------------

We pushed v3.9.2 last night, making improvements to Cline's diff editing and adding recommended models. Here's what this means for you as a developerðŸ§µ

--------------------

Benefit for setup: Faster configuration with recommended models. Cline 3.9.2 guides you by suggesting optimal models (like Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 4 Maverick/Scout) directly within the provider setup, saving you lookup time.
