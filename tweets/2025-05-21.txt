So, what are Workflows? Think of them as automation scripts. You define a sequence of actions using natural language, Cline's own tools (like read_file or ask_followup_question), CLI comands, or even MCPs -- all within a Markdown (.md) file. here's an example ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/SgBYHtV7uo

Update to Cline v3.16 now via VS Code Marketplace, Cursor, or Windsurf! Let us know what you think!

--------------------

Low-hanging fruit you should think about automating: - Release processes: grabbing PRs, building changelogs, version bumps. - New project setups: folder structures, dependency installs, config files. - Custom reports: gathering stats, formatting data.

--------------------

So, what are Workflows? They're your custom automation scripts, written in simple Markdown files (.md) and stored right in your project. https://t.co/mWORB2lEFf

--------------------

How do you spot a task perfect for a Workflow? Ask yourself: "Do I often do X, then Y, then Z?" If you can describe a sequence, itâ€™s a prime candidate.

--------------------

Think of them as LEGO blocks for your development process. You can combine: - Cline's built-in tools (read_file, ask_followup_question, etc.) - CLI commands (like gh, docker) - MCP tool calls

--------------------

And more refinements: - Global Endpoint for Vertex AI: Better availability. (Thanks soniqua!) - Key Fixes: Addressed memory leaks &amp; eternal loading states. (Thanks BarreiroT!) - Smoother Settings: VSCode Advanced settings now in Settings Webview; Auto-Approve UI polished.
