"Intelligence too cheap to meter is well within grasp" - Sam Altman just laid out the future of AI.

Here's why we've been building Cline for this exact future—where inference abundance, not scarcity, defines how developers work.

We made a deliberate choice:

While others architect around inference scarcity (caps, throttling, hidden operations), we built for abundance.

Why? Because limiting AI to protect margins is like rationing water next to the ocean. The economics are already shifting.

Our architecture reflects this belief:
- No artificial context limits
- Full transparency (see every file read, every edit)
- Bring your own API key
- Use any model, any provider

We don't profit from inference. We profit from making developers more powerful.

This isn't theoretical. Our community already experiences this daily.

Developers tell us they're 2-3x more productive. They tackle entire refactors, build complex features, debug across massive codebases.

When you remove artificial limits, developers do incredible things.

Altman: "technical people...have made fun of 'the idea guys'...It now looks to me like they are about to have their day in the sun."

Our users are already there—focusing on architecture and vision while Cline handles implementation details. The future is here.

But abundance without alignment is chaos.

That's why our glass-box approach matters. As AI grows more powerful, you need MORE visibility, not less.

Every action transparent. Every decision traceable. Human-in-the-loop by design.

This is how we build trust at scale.

We're not done. As inference costs plummet, we're building:
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Deeper IDE integrations  
- Richer MCP ecosystem

All open source. All transparent. All designed for the abundant future that's already arriving.

Join 2M+ developers already experiencing development without limits.

Cline is free, open source, and works with any model.

--------------------

Speaking of alignment, as AI capabilities grow, human intent becomes the critical 5%. We've seen this in how our users work with Cline.

Early on, we noticed users (and ourselves internally) asking Cline to not write code until given permission. They needed brakes for AI eagerness.

This observation was the precursor to our Plan-Act paradigm. It's not just a mode—it's a recognition that agentic AI requires space for human intent.

Plan phase: gather intent, ask questions, align. Act phase: execute uninterrupted. Two phases, one AI, optimized for collaboration.

↓

Interestingly, we see Plan-Act as both a crutch for current model eagerness and a fundamental paradigm. Agents aren't just fixing bugs—they need direction.

We almost didn't build it, hesitant to add complexity. Cline must feel intuitive out of the box. But user needs drove us forward.

↓

It's validating to see other AI coding tools adopt similar approaches recently. It confirms what we observed months ago about the need for intent.

We're open to evolving how planning looks—tweaks, new form factors. What do you think? How should intent-gathering shape AI collaboration?
