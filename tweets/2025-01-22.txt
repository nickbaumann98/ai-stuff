@phuctm97 @cursor_ai Thanks for checking out Cline! ðŸš€ Unlike Cursor, Cline doesnâ€™t economize for token usage. You pay for your own tokens which means no shortcutsâ€”better context management, smarter edits, and more powerful results. It can cost more, but the output is worth it. https://t.co/ZKRYik2oaf
