When your AI coding agent goes off track, your instinct is to course-correct. To explain what you really meant. To clarify, rephrase, add constraints.

But here's the thing: you're swimming upstream. Each correction adds more context pollution.

There's a better way.

--------------------

Research from Microsoft and Salesforce just confirmed what we've been seeing: LLMs experience a 39% performance drop when you try to guide them through multiple conversation turns versus giving complete context upfront.

This fundamentally changes how we should think about AI interactions.

--------------------

Think about it: when the model takes a wrong turn, it's not working with a blank slate anymore. It's trying to reconcile your corrections with its own generated assumptions. 

It's like trying to merge back onto a highway from a field. The context is already polluted.

--------------------

Engineers at Anthropic have been advising people to treat their AI like a slot machine: if you don't get the result you want, don't try to fix it mid-conversation. Start fresh.

They're right, but starting fresh used to mean losing all your work. Not anymore.

--------------------

Message checkpoints in Cline let you have your cake and eat it too. When you realize the conversation has gone sideways:

1. Find the message where things diverged
2. Edit it to include what was missing
3. Restore the context to that exact point
4. Try again with better instructions

--------------------

You're not admitting defeat. You're working with how LLMs actually function. They're incredibly powerful when given the right context upfront, and incredibly stubborn when asked to change course mid-stream.

--------------------

This works whether you're in Plan mode refining your approach or in Act mode watching the execution go off the rails. The principle is the same: don't patch a polluted conversation. Reset to a clean context and provide better instructions.

--------------------

The next time you find yourself in a back-and-forth trying to steer your AI back on track, remember: you're not debugging the model. You're debugging your prompt. And the best way to debug a prompt is to rewrite it with hindsight, not wrestle with corrections.

--------------------

Stop course-correcting. Start checkpointing.
