Siddharth likened AI tools to self-driving cars â€“ they handle the mechanics, but humans provide the destination and the "why." Without genuine human intent â€“ a unique vision, taste, understanding â€“ AI output often feels soulless. As he put it, AI can write well, "but there's no

--------------------

Step 2: Define the specific 'Actions' in Zapier that you want Cline to be able to trigger. Think 'Send Slack Message', 'Create Google Doc', 'Add Row to Sheet', etc. These become tools Cline can use. [link-to-media] https://t.co/2dWFZBhLGb

--------------------

Example 1: Get dynamic data. Ask Cline: "Get the current star count from the Cline GitHub repo." The `browseruseagent` tool navigates, finds the dynamic element, and returns the number. Simple, direct web interaction. https://t.co/bMjuT6ckdx

--------------------

This works using Zapier's remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Unlike local servers, there's no code to run yourself â€“ Zapier hosts it. You just get a secure URL endpoint that lets Cline talk to your Zapier account.

--------------------

Now, automate tasks that bridge coding and other tools. For example, after a commit, you could tell Cline: "Use Zapier to post 'Deployment started for feature X' to the #dev channel in Slack." Cline finds the action and triggers the Zap.

--------------------

So how do we leverage AI without losing that essential human touch? Siddharth argues for workflows that augment, not automate, creativity. It's about abstracting the grunt work ("things that don't need judgment") while keeping human vision firmly in the driver's seat.

Seamless Content Integration: - Markdownify: Effortlessly convert PDFs, DOCX, webpages, audio, YouTube videos &amp; more into clean Markdown. Perfect for docs, notes, or feeding context to Cline. https://t.co/eRw6DwWKpf

--------------------

Example 2: Extract specific content. Ask Cline: "What's the top story title on Hacker News?" The agent navigates https://t.co/3h74YYK1sH, finds the first link, and extracts the title. Useful for quick info gathering or monitoring. https://t.co/n54lQ6TJZw

Chatted with Siddharth Ahuja (@sidahuj), creator of the viral Ableton/Blender MCPs. Key takeaway: As AI gets better at execution, the real challenge is preserving *human intent* to avoid generic "AI slop." ðŸ§µ https://t.co/S9sgICeN6F

--------------------

This points to a "Human Editor &amp; AI Agent" model. The human directs (provides intent, taste, feedback), while the AI agent (like Cline, using tools + MCP) executes and iterates. The back-and-forth itself helps refine the core idea, infusing it with human judgment.

@lukevanin Gemini is currently limiting the use for 2.5 Pro requests, there are no ways to pay for more usage that this time.

--------------------

Step 3: Add the Zapier MCP endpoint URL to your Cline settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` -"Cline: Edit MCP Settings"). Cline will then discover the Zapier Actions you've enabled. (Restart Cline if you add new Zapier actions later). [link-to-media] https://t.co/b093OSQpj2

Ultimately, the differentiator isn't just AI sophistication, but the quality of human intent guiding it. Tools built for transparency &amp; human oversight help, but it requires a conscious commitment from creators. Read more insights from our chat: https://t.co/r4KDBc1jtd
