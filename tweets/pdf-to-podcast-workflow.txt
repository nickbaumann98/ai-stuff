We turned a 50-question PDF on LLMs into a 10-episode podcast series, with Cline orchestrating the entire process from start to finish.

Hereâ€™s a look at the workflow that made it possible. ðŸ§µ

--------------------

It all started with this great resource on LLM basics shared by @omarsar0.

--------------------

First, we prompted Cline to have Gemini 2.5 Pro read the PDF and restructure its content. Cline generated a script for each of the 10 episodes in the series.

--------------------

Next, Cline used the ElevenLabs MCP server to convert each script into high-quality audio, generating all 10 MP3 files directly from the editor.

--------------------

To wrap it up, Cline organized the entire project, moving the new text and audio files into a dedicated `podcast_series` folder and creating a consolidated transcript of the full series.

--------------------

The entire workflow, from a single PDF to a complete, organized podcast series, was handled in one continuous conversation.
