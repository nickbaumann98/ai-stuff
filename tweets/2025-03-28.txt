Developers: MCP is about to become extremely relevant as AI needs to connect with real-world data. Most don't know how to build MCP servers yet. Here's how to build them with Cline in 3 simple steps using our .clinerules protocol.

--------------------

This is massive for agent infrastructure. OpenAI adopting MCP instead of creating their own protocol means we now have a universal standard for agents to connect with tools and data. Network effects are accelerating - the time to build on MCP is now. ðŸ§µ https://t.co/D5esbzxD2B

--------------------

MCP Resources allow your MCP servers to expose specific data to Cline. They're how servers provide context from your local environment to Cline: ðŸ§µ https://t.co/PihZKF9CRu

--------------------

Step 3: TESTING The .clinerules protocol REQUIRES testing before completion: &gt;Each tool is tested with valid inputs &gt;Output formats are verified &gt;Results are documented This ensures robust plugins every time. https://t.co/Vbd5I2sW1i

--------------------

Think of Resources as extending what your MCP servers know about. Better informed servers = more helpful responses when you're working with Cline.

--------------------

Step 2: BUILDING Switch to ACT MODE and Cline helps implement your plugin: &gt;Bootstrap the project structure &gt;Implement core functionality with the MCP SDK &gt;Add error handling and logging https://t.co/IBAb6JWCm1

--------------------

MCP servers with well-configured Resources understand your workspace better. This makes Cline's interactions with those servers much more productive.

--------------------

MCP Resources are read-only data that enhance your servers' understanding of your environment. They provide crucial context without executing any code.

--------------------

In simple terms: Resources let your MCP servers expose files, code, logs, database info -- any contextual data - directly to Cline when needed.

Cline users are combining models strategically: - Gemini 2.5 Pro for planning &amp; handling large codebases (leveraging its 1M token context) - Claude Sonnet 3.7 for implementation &amp; UI work (precision execution) "I'm doing 2.5 plan and 3.7 act" is becoming a common pattern, with https://t.co/Lwfi3Rrg9o

Step 1: PLANNING Start by describing what you want to build. Cline will help define: &gt;Problem your plugin solves &gt;APIs or services to integrate &gt;Desired outputs Cline guides this entire phase using our protocol. https://t.co/1LgMtJVAuP

--------------------

Resources are essentially context providers for your MCP servers. They give your servers more information to work with, making them more capable during your Cline sessions.

--------------------

Want your MCP servers to better understand your codebase? Add relevant Resources -- it's the most direct way to give them the context they need to be truly helpful.

--------------------

The key advantage: Resources give your MCP servers direct access to your project context -- source files, configs, logs, documentation - so Cline doesn't need to guess.

--------------------

For developers: Adding Resources to your MCP servers means they'll have more context about your specific projects, leading to more relevant assistance in Cline.
