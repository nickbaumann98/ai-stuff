2/ PRICE ROUTING Prioritizes the most cost-effective AI provider for each request, helping you conserve credits. Good for: Non-urgent projects, exploration, personal projects, and tasks where response time isn't the priority. https://t.co/dPulZ1HEvl

--------------------

3/ THROUGHPUT ROUTING Routes to providers with highest capacity (like DeepSeek) when you need to process large requests. Good for: Large refactoring jobs, codebase analysis, generating test suites, and handling multiple parallel requests. https://t.co/o3XjLs6Iw5

--------------------

4/ LATENCY ROUTING Prioritizes providers with lowest response times when speed matters most. Good for: Live coding sessions, urgent debugging, demo preparation, and those final hours before a deadline. https://t.co/QlPfqDNllJ

When you see that lightbulb icon, you can now choose "Fix with Cline" to instantly create a new task with your code and error context already loaded. Cline gets everything it needs to solve the problem without you having to explain what went wrong. A smarter way to handle https://t.co/nZhUQ20u9R

--------------------

The new "Add to Cline" right-click feature helps you manage context more efficiently as your codebase grows. Simply right-click on code, error messages, or terminal output to instantly add it to your current Cline task -- perfect for complex projects where context control is https://t.co/jfLl35xgkl
