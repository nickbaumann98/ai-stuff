MCP servers unlock Cline's full potential. Here are 6 of our favorites: üßµ https://t.co/Xsmz7x1ILo

--------------------

Did you know Cline can query your PostgreSQL databases? With the PostgreSQL MCP server, you can ask questions like 'what's our most popular drama movie?' and Cline will write + execute the actual query against your database. MCP server linked below üëá Watch: https://t.co/st3Hzp7A2k

@kregenrek Our users are finding that Mermaid diagrams might be a workflow language that LLMs are acutely well-versed in. This has positive implications for prompting blogüëá

--------------------

6/ File System MCP - Smart codebase navigation - Blazing fast search across projects - Intelligent file operations https://t.co/pIFs3rEQwm

--------------------

1/ Start with Planning-First Development instead of jumping straight to code generation. Use Cline's context building commands: @ files - Share existing code @ folders - Project structure @ urls - Documentation @ problems - IDE diagnostics

--------------------

3/ When implementing complex features, break them into clear phases: ‚úì Core auth endpoints ‚úì Session management ‚óªÔ∏è OAuth integration ‚óªÔ∏è Rate limiting Don't try to maintain global context - work in focused chunks.

--------------------

Hot take: Mermaid diagrams aren't just for documentation -- they're a formal language that helps Cline understand your codebase better than text. A flowchart is unambiguous. Each node and connection is explicitly defined üéØ

--------------------

2/ Git MCP Server - Smart commit management and PR workflows - Code search and navigation - Branch operations without leaving Cline https://t.co/Le9DfcVIrJ

--------------------

1/3 Our community is experimenting with using Mermaid for both documentation AND instruction. It's like giving your AI assistant a precise map instead of vague directions. https://t.co/qbQtxugXUC

--------------------

2/ Project Memory Management is critical. Create focused context files that Cline can reference: https://t.co/dLV1NeaFYc
