Happy weekend ðŸ«¡

Here's 12 professional AI coding techniques from a recent engineering best practices session ðŸ‘‡

1. Plan for 10 minutes before coding for 2 hours. Brief your AI like onboarding a new developer: architecture, constraints, goals, existing patterns. This saves hours of refactoring later.

2. Use premium models for complex work. Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M tokens) and Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet deliver significantly better results than budget models. The cost difference is often worth it for complex tasks.

3. Keep an eye on your context window. Performance drops after 50% capacity. Use implementation docs, handoff summaries, or /newtask to stay sharp across long sessions.

4. Create rules files for your standards. Define coding patterns, project structure, and workflows once. Every AI session starts with this context automatically. Developers report significantly less rework.

5. Share your full intent upfront. Your AI can read files but doesn't know your goals, constraints, or vision. Explain what you're trying to achieve and why to create mutual understanding.

6. Treat AI like a brilliant but forgetful developer. It can write incredible code but needs constant guidance on what you're trying to achieve.

7. Be in collaborative planning mode. Don't jump straight to implementation. Discuss architecture, explore alternatives, validate approaches before writing a single line.

8. Leverage memory banks for long projects. Create markdown files that AI maintains with project context, progress, and learnings. Huge for complex builds and when handing off work.

9. Consider premium models for complex work. Developers using top-tier models often ship faster than those optimizing purely for cost. The productivity gains can justify the expense.

10. Learn context management strategies. Know when to condense (/smol), when to start fresh (/newtask), when to create handoff docs. This separates effective developers from struggling ones.

11. Build team knowledge with shared rules files. Version control your AI instructions. New team members get instant context on how your team codes.

12. Embrace the paradigm shift. This isn't about replacing developers -- it's about amplifying human insight with AI capabilities. The best teams learned this early.

The goal: build better software faster. AI is your force multiplier, not your replacement.
