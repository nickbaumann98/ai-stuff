Our community has been testing the new DeepSeek R1-0528 model. Here's what Cline power users are actually saying: ðŸ§µ

--------------------

First question everyone asks: Is it good for coding?

"FYI i dont necessarly think DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B will be a good coder.... but could be a very good planner..."

"It should be able to plan just fine. I just wouldn't use it for act"

--------------------

The math checks out. AIME accuracy jumped from 70% to 87.5%, with reasoning depth doubling (12K to 23K tokens per question). Strong planning capabilities, but users prefer other models for implementation.

--------------------

Speed varies by provider. Some users report "painfully slow for Plan" on certain API endpoints, while others find it reasonably fast.

"smart for an 8b" when it works well

--------------------

Cost is where it shines. Users report Claude 3 Opus-level planning at 1/7th the cost. The emerging workflow:

1. Use R1-0528 for architectural planning
2. Switch to Claude/V3 for coding
3. Save 80%+ on costs

--------------------

Availability: Live in Cline now through multiple API providers. Performance varies - some providers are faster than others. OpenRouter has both free and paid tiers available.

Most users will access it via API rather than running locally.

--------------------

Bottom line from our community: R1-0528 is reshaping how people think about Plan vs Act mode. Not the best coder, but excellent for deep architectural thinking at a fraction of the cost.

Worth trying if you do complex planning work.

--------------------

Try it in Cline today. We're curious about your experience - especially compared to your current planning model.

# /newtask vs /smol Context Management Thread

Two commands in Cline can dramatically improve your development workflow while keeping token costs in check: /newtask and /smol. ðŸ§µ

--------------------

Your context window fills up fast when working on complex projects. Documentation searches, file reads, debugging attempts - all valuable, but they create noise that can double your API costs with providers like Google (which charges 2x after 200k tokens).

--------------------

/newtask works like a perfect developer handoff. It intelligently packages what matters - the overall plan, work accomplished, relevant files, and next steps - into a fresh task with a clean context window.

--------------------

Use /newtask when:
- Moving from research to implementation
- Completing logical phases of work
- Context is 75%+ full but you're switching focus
- You want to preserve full conversation history

Think: "bringing a new developer onto the project"

--------------------

/smol compresses your current conversation into a comprehensive summary, freeing up context space while staying in the same task. Perfect for maintaining flow during deep debugging or iterative development sessions.

--------------------

Use /smol when:
- Deep in debugging and need to continue
- Iterating on the same feature
- Don't want to break your momentum
- Context is full but you're staying focused

Think: "summarizing the story so far"

--------------------

The choice isn't just technical - it's about workflow:

/newtask = Clean slate, new focus, preserved history
/smol = Compressed history, same flow, irreversible summary

Both save tokens, but serve different development rhythms.

--------------------

The key insight: context window economics matter, but the solution should enhance your workflow, not disrupt it.

--------------------

Master context management in Cline and you'll code more efficiently while keeping costs predictable.

Try /newtask for clean transitions, /smol for flow states.

# Context7 MCP: Solving the Static Knowledge Problem

LLMs have static knowledge cutoffs. They don't know about library updates, new APIs, or breaking changes that happened after training. Context7 bridges this gap by injecting real-time docs into Cline. ðŸ§µ

--------------------

The reality: Claude was trained on data up to early 2024. If you're using a library that updated in the last year, the AI is working with outdated information.

This leads to:
- Deprecated method suggestions
- Missing new features  
- Incompatible syntax patterns
- Hours debugging "working" code

--------------------

Context7 solves this by fetching current documentation on-demand. Just add "use context7" to your Cline prompt and it pulls the latest docs for 4000+ libraries.

[link-to-media]

--------------------

Example: Ask for a Next.js app router setup. Without Context7, you might get pages/ directory structure. With Context7, you get current app/ directory patterns.

The difference between code that compiles and code that doesn't often comes down to having current documentation.

--------------------

Context7 ensures Cline always has the latest information instead of guessing based on stale training data.

Setup is simple: Download Context7 from the Cline MCP Marketplace, then append "use context7" to any prompt involving external libraries.

--------------------

No more debugging phantom APIs or wrestling with deprecated patterns. Just current, working code from the start.
