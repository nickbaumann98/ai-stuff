5/ One enterprise user says it best: "MCP lets us connect our AI assistant to every part of our development pipeline. It's not just coding anymore - it's a true development partner."

--------------------

6/ The ecosystem is growing rapidly. Teams are building: - Self-improving systems that learn from usage - Cross-project knowledge sharing - Advanced multi-tool workflows

--------------------

3/ The community has already built a ton of innovative MCP servers including: - GitHub issue automation - Knowledge graph integration - API testing with Postman - Browser automation with Playwright - Database analysis tools

--------------------

4/ The GitHub MCP server lets Cline handle everything from file updates to repository management https://t.co/jtoV1LRapC

1/ The Model Context Protocol isn't just another dev tool - it's letting AI assistants break free from chat windows to directly manage your Git repos, run tests, and maintain project memory. Here's why MCP is a game-changer üßµ https://t.co/gMDpRVnFGd
