"[AI] is making stuff which is still quite generic and we're trying to push the boundary."

A YC founder on why they use 21st.dev's Magic MCP with Cline to build UI.

--------------------
AI code generation is powerful, but can often produce generic code that reeks of "this is an AI-generated website".

It lacks taste.
--------------------
The 21st.dev Magic MCP for Cline solves this. It doesn't write code from scratch.

Instead, it pulls from a library of high-quality, production-ready components based on your natural language description.

- "responsive navbar with logo"
- "pricing card with gradient"
--------------------
This gives your AI agent design taste.

You get the speed of AI with the quality of a curated component library. This is how you move from "generic" to production-ready, fast.
