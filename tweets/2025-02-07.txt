The $200K+ mistake AI companies make isn’t hiring great ML talent—it’s hiring them too early. What they actually need first: ✅ Engineers who build robust measurement systems ✅ People who ask, “How do we measure success?” before, “How do we fine-tune?” ✅ Teams focused on

Unfortunately, AI coding assistants aren't quite psychics who can read your mind. Here's how to get past the '75% problem' in AI development and unlock truly collaborative coding: 🧵 https://t.co/jOWFzC2uZt

--------------------

2. Start with a complete implementation doc It's simple: - Have your AI read ALL relevant source files - Get it to ask about edge cases - Create actual examples together - Build shared understanding

--------------------

5. The results speak for themselves: - More maintainable code - Faster iterations - True human-AI collaboration It's not about limitations -- it's about process. AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful when you work with them rather than just throwing requirements over the

--------------------

3. Break features into atomic units The secret is manageability: - Focus on smaller, testable chunks - Keep context fresh and focused - Build iteratively together

--------------------

1. The first 75% of AI coding is magical. You describe a feature, and boom - working code appears. But there's an art to handling that final 25% effectively.

4. Fresh sessions for implementation The key is clean context: - Start with your collaborative doc - New context = cleaner output - Build systematically
