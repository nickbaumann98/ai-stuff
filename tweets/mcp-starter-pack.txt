Stop context-switching. Start building.

Our new guide to the MCP starter pack shows you how to integrate web search, live documentation, and browser automation directly into your Cline workflow. It's the fastest way to make your AI a true development partner. ðŸ§µ

1/ Supercharge your AI's knowledge with the Perplexity MCP. Give Cline access to the entire web for up-to-date research, so you never have to leave your editor to find answers.
