Thanks to our friends over at @v0 for helping us bring their new model to Cline ðŸ«¡ Check the docs below on how to use it in Cline!

--------------------

How to use it in Cline: - Enable "Extended thinking" in the sidebar - Use the slider to set your budget (1,024 to 6,553 tokens) - Increase for complex debugging or architecture decisions https://t.co/cF3jgrhhKJ

--------------------

Extended Thinking gives Claude time to work through problems methodically before responding. Instead of instant answers, Claude breaks down the problem, considers approaches, and catches potential issues -- like how experienced developers actually think.

--------------------

Claude Opus 4 with Extended Thinking achieved 58% better performance on reasoning tasks. Sonnet 4 saw 68% improvement. Here's how to unlock Claude's deeper reasoning capabilities in Cline -- and when to use Extended Thinking vs Sequential Thinking MCP ðŸ§µ (via @arcprize ) https://t.co/2Dt9xzBnBM

--------------------

Use Extended Thinking when: - You want deeper reasoning with faster results - You trust Claude's approach and want the final answer - You're working on general coding or reasoning tasks

--------------------

Live in Cline: DeepSeek-R1-0528 It's showing significant benchmark gains, now matching OpenAI o3 in reasoning tasks (key for Plan mode). We're excited to observe how these improvements impact real-world coding performance in Cline. https://t.co/rqZkZvMNHK

--------------------

Use Sequential MCP when: - You're not using Claude - Problems require self-correction and branching logic - You need to understand exactly how the LLM reached its conclusion

--------------------

https://t.co/44DLEzYtJD

--------------------

Pro tip: You can use both together. Extended Thinking gives Claude more reasoning capacity, while Sequential Thinking MCP structures that reasoning into visible, revisable steps. The combination unlocks Claude's most sophisticated problem-solving capabilities.

--------------------

Sequential Thinking MCP offers a different approach: structured, visible reasoning. &amp; it can be used with any model. https://t.co/Y4PWPJP8J5

--------------------

Both approaches make Claude significantly smarter. Extended Thinking is perfect for most complex tasks. Sequential Thinking MCP is ideal when you need transparency and self-correcting logic.

--------------------

The key difference: Extended Thinking: Claude thinks deeply in private, then shows you a summary of its reasoning plus the answer. Sequential Thinking MCP: Claude thinks step-by-step in the open, can question its own logic, and you see the full reasoning process unfold.

Official announcement:

--------------------

Instead of thinking privately then showing a summary, the LLM breaks problems into numbered steps, can revise previous thoughts, branch into new approaches, and you see everything.
