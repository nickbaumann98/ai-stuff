Auto Approve Productivity Tip

Quick tip for new Cline users: Start with auto-approving read access to project files and set a request limit of 10-20.

This gives Cline enough freedom to explore your codebase without constant interruptions, while still requiring permission for edits or potentially destructive actions.

You can always adjust permissions as you build trust - tighten for production work, loosen for prototyping.
