This low cost makes o4-mini particularly attractive for planning and architectural tasks. Developers are leveraging its reasoning for brainstorming complex systems, outlining features, and getting insightful feedback without breaking the bank.

--------------------

ðŸ§µ OpenAI's o4-mini seems to be hitting a sweet spot in Planning for developers. With a 200K token context window and strong reasoning, it rivals pricier models but costs just $1.10 input / $4.40 output per 1M tokens â€“ nearly 90% cheaper than o3 ($10/$40 per 1M).

--------------------

"...in terms of the sheer amazing outputs it gives for reasoning/planning/ect." - It provides "excellent insights" and catches "key problems" when reviewing system designs.
