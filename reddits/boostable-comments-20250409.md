**Current Score**: 1
**Text**: "I don't really use it for coding since I'm fully on board with Cline at this point, though that may change when Grok 3 makes its way to their API (right now it's only Grok 2, which is a decent model but not competitive with others for the price), for coding I use Cline with Deepseek-R1 for the 'Plan' portion and Claude 3.7 for the 'Act', both through Openrouter, though now that Gemini 2.5 Preview has billing enabled I'll be trying to use it for a bit to compare."

**Why boostable**: User expresses being "fully on board with Cline" and describes their specific workflow using different models with Cline, showing genuine satisfaction with the product.

**Current Score**: 1
**Text**: "The core value of Cline/Roocode/Cursor/Copilot comes from the models. Without the quality leap that Sonnet 3.5 there would be no Cline or Roo. That was the core of the magic."

**Why boostable**: Comment recognizes the value of Cline as a quality interface to powerful models, highlighting its importance in the AI coding ecosystem.
