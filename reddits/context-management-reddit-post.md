# Context Management Beyond Memory Bank: Advanced Techniques for Large Projects

I've noticed several posts here discussing issues with context windows, especially when using models like Gemini 2.5 Pro with its massive 1M+ context, and the classic problem of AI agents suddenly "forgetting" critical context at the worst possible moment.

Memory Bank is great (and if you're not using it yet, [check it out](https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/custom-instructions-library/cline-memory-bank)), but for truly complex projects, you need more advanced strategies. Here's what I've found works best:

## Context Window Management: The Visual Approach

The context window progress bar isn't just a pretty UI element - it's your early warning system. Some practical tips:

* Start planning for context refresh when you hit 70% usage
* Plan resets at natural boundaries (after completing discrete features)

## Using Plan & Act Modes as Context Management Tools

One underappreciated aspect of Plan/Act modes is how they help manage context:

* Use *Plan mode* to front-load Cline with critical project context
* The context gathered in Plan mode carries over to Act mode
* When you hit a complex decision point in Act mode, consider switching back to Plan mode to rebuild context

This create-load-preserve cycle helps maintain coherence across long sessions, especially when you're approaching context limits.

## Task-Specific Context Files: Beyond Memory Bank

Memory Bank is a project-wide context system, but for complex projects, I've found value in creating task-specific context files:

```markdown
# auth-system-implementation.md

## Requirements
- OAuth2 implementation with Google and GitHub
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Session timeout after 30min

## Technical Decisions
- Using Passport.js for provider integration
- JWT for session management
- Redis for rate limiting

## Progress
- ✅ Basic auth flow implemented
- ✅ Google OAuth integration
- ⬜ GitHub OAuth integration
- ⬜ Rate limiting implementation
```

These focused context files can be quickly shared at the start of a new session, giving Cline precisely what it needs without bloating the context window.

## Checkpoints: Your Context Safety Net

Checkpoints are criminally underused, but they're essential for:

1. *Protecting Against Context Loss*: Create checkpoints before making major changes
2. *A/B Testing Approaches*: Create checkpoints to try different implementation strategies
3. *Rollback Points*: Create checkpoints when you've got something working before adding more features

The key insight: checkpoints preserve not just your code, but also the context at that moment - which means they can help you recover from context window resets.

## Advanced Workflow Patterns for Different Models

Each model has different context capabilities, which means they excel at different parts of the development workflow:

* *Claude 3.7 Sonnet (200k tokens)*: Ideal for initial project exploration and planning
* *Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M+ tokens)*: Great for marathon implementation sessions, but watch token costs
* *Llama 4 Scout (10M tokens)*: Perfect for whole-codebase analysis, but use selectively
* *DeepSeek (64k tokens)*: Best for focused implementations of well-defined tasks

A hybrid approach works best: Use high-context models for planning and understanding, then switch to more focused models for implementation.

## Practical Example: Breaking Down Complex Projects

Here's my workflow for a recent complex project:

1. *Initial Exploration (Claude)*: Load entire codebase structure to build understanding
2. *Architecture Planning (Claude → Memory Bank)*: Create architecture diagrams and document key patterns
3. *Component Implementation (DeepSeek)*: Implement discrete components with targeted context
4. *Integration (Gemini)*: Bring components together using larger context window
5. *Maintenance (Memory Bank + Scout)*: Use Memory Bank for ongoing work, Llama 4 Scout for big refactors

The key insight: context windows aren't just about size - they're about efficient use of the right context at the right time.

What are your best context management techniques? Have you found other approaches that work well for specific models or project types?
