### 1. Thread: "What MCP servers we must use it to better productivity?" (r/CLine)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jo5fkk/what_mcp_servers_we_must_use_it_to_better/
*   **Context:** User `master-selo` is asking for recommendations on useful MCP servers beyond the browser tool. Other users mentioned Firecrawl and Perplexity.
*   **Suggested Reply 1 (Direct & Resourceful):**
    ```
    Hey master-selo, Nick from Cline here. Great question! Choosing the right MCP servers really depends on your specific goals. For general productivity and research, Perplexity (`github.com/pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp`) and Firecrawl (`github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server`) are indeed popular choices, great for searching and scraping web content.

    If you're doing coding tasks, the GitHub server (`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github`) is essential for interacting with repos. For UI work, the 21st.dev Magic MCP (`github.com/21st-dev/magic-mcp`) is fantastic for generating components.

    We have a blog post explaining MCP servers in more detail that might give you more ideas: [Link to blogs/mcp-servers-explained-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-why-cline-is-revolutionizing-ai-tools.md - *Need Substack URL*]

    What kind of tasks are you hoping to improve with MCP servers? Knowing that could help narrow down the best options!

    ```
    Hey master-selo! Nick here (I work on Cline). Awesome that you're diving into MCP servers! Perplexity and Firecrawl are definitely solid recommendations for research/web tasks.

    To add to the list, depending on what you're building:
    *   **Coding:** The official GitHub MCP is super useful.
    *   **UI:** Check out the 21st.dev Magic MCP for components.
    *   **Writing/Content:** The Typefully MCP (`typefully-mcp`) helps schedule tweets.

    Like coding_workflow asked, what's your main focus? Coding, writing, data analysis? That helps tailor the recommendations. You can also browse existing servers or even build your own! Check out our guide: [Link to docs/mcp/README.md]

### 2. Thread: "Is there a way to have separate custom instructions for plan and act mode?" (r/CLine)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jnr0v2/is_there_a_way_to_have_separate_custom/
*   **Context:** User `shades2134` asked about separate instructions. You (`nick-baumann`) already replied (`mkmzj1v`), and they responded (`mkn335p`) clarifying their reasoning (avoiding conditional complexity, defining specific workflows). RooCode was mentioned as having this feature.
*   **Suggested Follow-up Reply to `shades2134` (replying to `mkn335p`):**
    ```
    Hey shades2134, thanks for clarifying! That makes sense. You're right that complex conditional logic *can* sometimes confuse LLMs, though structuring it clearly with distinct sections like `IF MODE IS PLAN:` and `IF MODE IS ACT:` often works well.

    The example I linked tries to show that structure. We've found it effective for defining different tool usage or focus areas for each mode.

    It's valuable feedback that truly separate instruction sets would be preferred for distinct workflows. I'll pass that along to the team! In the meantime, structuring the single instruction set clearly is the best approach. Let me know if you run into specific issues trying that!

    ```
    Hey who_am_i_to_say_so, Nick from Cline here. Totally understand the frustration with manual retries on API errors – thanks for the candid feedback! It's definitely something that can interrupt the flow.

    Awesome that you're considering a PR! We love community contributions. An automatic retry mechanism, perhaps with configurable backoff like others mentioned, is a great suggestion. We've heard similar feedback and it's on our radar. If you do decide to work on a PR, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repo first to discuss the approach!
    ```
*   **Suggested Reply (General / Addressing RooCode mentions):**
    ```
    Hey folks, Nick from Cline here. Appreciate the discussion around API error handling. Automatic retries are definitely a valid point and something we're looking into to improve the experience, especially with models prone to rate limits.

    While Cline and RooCode share some history, they often have different design philosophies. We aim for stability and clear control, but we're always evaluating ways to reduce friction like this. Thanks for the feedback!

### 4. Thread: "Cline + vertex AI --> Gemini 2.5 support?" (r/CLine)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jne8b5/cline_vertex_ai_gemini_25_support/
*   **Context:** User `keftes` can use Gemini 2.5 via the direct Gemini API key but not via Vertex AI provider in Cline.
*   **Suggested Reply to Original Poster (`keftes`):**
    ```
    Hey keftes, Nick from Cline here. Good question! Currently, accessing the newest models like Gemini 2.5 via Vertex AI sometimes lags behind the direct API availability due to how providers expose models.

    It's likely that the specific model identifier for Gemini 2.5 isn't available *yet* through the Vertex AI integration Cline uses. We rely on the provider's API listing. We're constantly updating our provider integrations, so support should follow once Google makes it generally available via the Vertex AI API endpoints Cline connects to.

    For now, using the direct Gemini API key (as you are) is the best way to access 2.5 in Cline. We'll keep an eye on Vertex AI updates!

### 5. Thread: "In concrete terms, how does CLINE work?" (r/CLine)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jmobz4/in_concrete_terms_how_does_cline_work/
*   **Context:** User `Ratonomist` is asking about the underlying mechanics of Cline and the role of MCP. Several comments discuss prompts, integrations, and comparisons.
*   **Suggested Reply to Original Poster (`Ratonomist`):**
    ```
    Hey Ratonomist, Nick from Cline here. Great question about how Cline works under the hood!

    At its core, as some commenters noted, Cline uses a sophisticated system prompt (you can see the base version on our GitHub: https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/core/prompts/system.ts) combined with tight VS Code integrations. This allows it to understand your project structure, use tools like file editing and terminal commands effectively, and manage context.

    MCP (Model Context Protocol) extends this by allowing Cline to use *additional* tools provided by external servers (like the Reddit server, GitHub, Perplexity, etc.), making it much more versatile. While Cline can read/write files natively, MCP enables specialized actions beyond the core toolset.

    The "magic" comes from combining a strong core agent with this extensible tool system and a focus on letting the agent work with minimal restrictions (while keeping you in the loop for approval). Hope that helps clarify! Happy to answer more specific questions.

    ```
    Hey Mission_Mango_7763, Nick from Cline here. Appreciate you sharing your workaround for the Gemini 2.5 rate limits! It's definitely a hot topic right now. That manual rotation is clever, though definitely a hassle.

    It highlights the current challenges with accessing cutting-edge models during experimental phases. We're always looking at ways to improve provider integrations and handle these kinds of API issues more gracefully (like the auto-retry discussion in other threads). Thanks for sharing your experience!

### 7. Thread: "cline vs cursor" (r/CLine)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jlt61w/cline_vs_cursor/
*   **Context:** User `argsmatter` asks for comparisons between Cline and Cursor. Comments discuss security, cost, workflow, and specific features.
*   **Suggested Reply (General):**
    ```
    Hey folks, Nick from Cline here. Really interesting discussion comparing Cline and Cursor! Appreciate all the perspectives shared.

    It highlights that different tools fit different workflows and priorities. We focus on providing a powerful, flexible agent with direct access to models and tools (like file system, terminal, MCP), emphasizing user control and transparency (BYO key model). Security and minimizing data sent externally (as `caledh` mentioned) are also key design principles for us.

    Cursor has a different approach with its integrated features and subscription model. Both have strengths! We believe Cline's agentic capabilities and the extensibility via MCP offer unique advantages for complex development tasks. Always happy to hear more feedback on how we can improve!
    ```
*   **Suggested Reply to `thedabking123` (asking for beginner tips):**
    ```
    Hey thedabking123, Nick from Cline here. Welcome! Great question about getting started effectively.

    For beginners, especially if budget isn't the primary constraint initially:
    1.  **Start Simple:** Use a capable model like Sonnet 3.7 or Gemini 2.5 for both Plan and Act modes initially to get a feel for it.
    2.  **Leverage Plan Mode:** Spend time in Plan mode to break down tasks. Ask Cline to outline steps before switching to Act. This helps guide the agent.
    3.  **Use Custom Instructions:** Define project-specific rules (like packages, venv setup) in the custom instructions. Keep them clear and concise. You can find examples in our docs! [Link to docs/prompting/README.md or specific examples]
    4.  **Review Edits:** Especially when starting, carefully review the diffs Cline proposes before approving. This helps you learn and catch potential issues.
    5.  **Checkpoints:** Use checkpoints frequently! They are lifesavers if the agent goes off track.

    Don't worry too much about hyper-optimizing cost at first. Focus on understanding the workflow and how to guide the agent effectively. You can introduce cheaper models for specific tasks later. Happy coding!

### 8. Thread: "Anyone using it for iOS projects, how to get rid of linting errors on imports?" (r/CLine)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jlummh/anyone_using_it_for_ios_projects_how_to_get_rid/
*   **Context:** User `TheFern3` is experiencing VS Code linting errors for iOS projects that don't appear in Xcode, causing Cline to repeatedly try fixing them.
*   **Suggested Reply to Original Poster (`TheFern3`):**
    ```
    Hey TheFern3, Nick from Cline here. That's a common annoyance when the VS Code linting environment doesn't perfectly match the Xcode build environment for iOS projects.

    Cline relies on the errors reported by VS Code's configured linter. To prevent Cline from constantly trying to "fix" these false positives, you have a couple of options:
    1.  **Configure VS Code Linter:** The best long-term solution is to configure your VS Code linter (e.g., SwiftLint extension settings in `.vscode/settings.json` or a `.swiftlint.yml` file) to align better with your Xcode project settings or to ignore specific rules causing the false positives. This makes VS Code itself more accurate.
    2.  **Custom Instructions:** You can add a custom instruction telling Cline to ignore specific types of linting errors related to imports if they are known false positives in VS Code for your setup. E.g., "Ignore linting errors related to module imports if the code builds correctly in Xcode."
    3.  **Direct Feedback:** As you're doing, telling Cline "Ignore these errors, they are fine in Xcode" works on a case-by-case basis.

    Hope that helps! Getting the VS Code linting setup right for the specific project is usually the most robust fix.

### 9. Thread: "Has Claude 3.7 become a stupid coder, lately?" (r/ClaudeAI)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1joajey/has_claude_37_become_a_stupid_coder_lately/
*   **Context:** User `Fantastic_Bus4643` feels Claude 3.7's coding ability has regressed, particularly with responsiveness issues and following instructions.
*   **Suggested Reply (General / Offering Cline Perspective):**
    ```
    Hey folks, interesting discussion on recent Claude 3.7 coding performance. Model behavior can definitely fluctuate.

    One thing we find helpful when working with *any* model in coding assistants like Cline is breaking down complex tasks (like fixing responsiveness across a whole layout) into smaller, more specific steps. Sometimes asking the model to "fix responsiveness" is too broad. Instead, asking it to "adjust the CSS for the header component to use flexbox for better responsiveness on mobile" can yield better results.

    Also, using tools that allow the model to interact with the actual code (like file editing in Cline) rather than just generating code blocks can help ground the model and lead to more iterative fixes. Just some thoughts from the agentic coding perspective!
    ```

### 10. Thread: "Frustrating Chat Limiting" (r/ClaudeAI)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jo8rzw/frustrating_chat_limiting/
*   **Context:** User `txxxyx` is hitting Claude 3.7 usage limits while coding and asking about using 3.5 effectively. Mentions vibe coding and project context size.
*   **Suggested Reply (Offering Cline Perspective):**
    ```
    Hey txxxyx, totally understand the frustration with hitting usage limits when you're in the coding flow! It's a common challenge with fixed-limit subscription models, especially on complex tasks.

    This is one reason why tools like Cline use a BYO (Bring Your Own) API key model. While it means paying per token, it removes arbitrary message limits and allows using the best model for the job without getting cut off mid-task (though you do need to be mindful of cost, especially with powerful models like 3.7 or Gemini 2.5).

    Regarding using 3.5 vs 3.7 – 3.5 is still quite capable, but for complex refactoring like DI, it might require more guidance or smaller steps compared to 3.7. It often helps to give 3.5 a very clear plan or summary from the 3.7 chat to continue effectively. Good luck with the Ollama UI project!

### 11. Thread: "If Siri had MCP support..." (r/aipromptprogramming)

*   **Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/aipromptprogramming/comments/1jnnae5/if_siri_had_mcp_support_it_would_be_the_most/
*   **Context:** Post speculates about Siri + MCP. Comments discuss feasibility and definition of "powerful".
*   **Suggested Reply (General / Explaining MCP):**
    ```
    Interesting thought experiment! The idea of combining a widely distributed voice interface like Siri with an extensible tool protocol like MCP is definitely intriguing.

    MCP (Model Context Protocol) essentially allows AI agents (like Cline in VS Code, or potentially Siri in this hypothetical) to discover and use tools provided by different servers – think accessing GitHub, searching the web via Perplexity, controlling smart home devices, etc., all through a standardized protocol.

    While Siri currently uses proprietary integrations, adopting something like MCP could theoretically unlock a vast ecosystem of capabilities without Apple needing to build every integration themselves. It's a cool vision for the future of AI assistants!
