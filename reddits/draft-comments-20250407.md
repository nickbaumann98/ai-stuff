### Short version:
I feel this pain. Those "sudden destruction" moments are real and frustrating. Two things that helped me drastically reduce them: 1) Using checkpoints obsessively before any major change (in Cline they're in the command palette), and 2) Breaking large changes into smaller, isolated code units. The agent is much less likely to go rogue with well-bounded tasks. Your instinct to commit frequently is good, but also try to add clean breakpoints in your workflow where you can fully validate before continuing.

### Longer version:
Full transparency - I work at Cline, but this is a real issue across all coding agents right now. That sudden "everything was fine until it wasn't" experience is legitimately infuriating.

The root issue is usually context window overload. After hours of work, the agent gradually accumulates more and more context about your project. At some point, it hits a tipping point where it tries to be "helpful" by making broader changes, but it's actually working with an incomplete mental model.

Here's what's worked well for me and other power users:

1. Checkpoints are your safety net - create them liberally before any significant change. In Cline, you can make checkpoints through the command palette.

2. Use Plan mode religiously for complex changes. Force the agent to articulate exactly what it plans to do before switching to Act mode.

3. Break longer sessions into discrete tasks with clear boundaries. After completing a well-defined unit of work, close that conversation and start fresh on the next piece.

4. Add memory bank entries for architectural decisions and patterns. This helps maintain consistency across sessions.

5. For critical work, enable approval for everything. Yes, it's annoying to approve every little change, but it gives you that crucial moment to review what it's about to do.

The good news is that agents are getting better at maintaining consistency. Between improved model capabilities and better tooling (like memory bank), these issues are becoming less frequent.

### Short version:
Test generation is honestly one of the trickier tasks for AI tools, especially integration tests on complex dataclasses. A couple suggestions that might help: 1) Start with a working example test you manually create, then ask Cline to use that as a template, and 2) Break the task into smaller steps - first just outline test cases, then implement one at a time with explicit verification. Less token usage and typically better results.

### Longer version:
Hey there - Nick from Cline here. First, I appreciate the detailed feedback and totally get your frustration. Test generation, especially integration tests, can be one of the trickier tasks for any AI tool.

A few thoughts that might help if you decide to give it another shot:

1. For test generation specifically, I've found the most cost-effective approach is a multi-step process:
   - First, create one working test manually (or with minimal AI help)
   - Then ask Cline to use that as a strict template for additional tests
   - This drastically reduces the "trial and error" token usage

2. Fixtures and mocks are tricky for AI - they require understanding your exact testing philosophy. Try explicitly telling Cline whether you prefer real objects or mocks in your prompt, and explain your testing approach.

3. For tight budgets, try enabling strict auto-approval limits. You can set tokens/day and tokens/request limits in settings to avoid surprise costs.

4. Memory bank can help tremendously. Add a memory bank entry that explains your test fixtures, mocking approach, and shows examples of working tests. This context gets loaded with every conversation.

For what it's worth, test generation is getting better with each model improvement, and we're actively working on reducing token usage for iterative coding tasks.

If you're looking for the most cost-efficient model for this kind of work, I'd recommend trying Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (the free version) or Llama 4 Scout, which has cheaper token costs.

## 3. Reply to "Stop telling me AI will replace programmers"

### Short version:
I've been in the exact same loop. The "productivity vs. skill atrophy" balance is real. What's worked for me is thinking of AI as my pair programmer, not my replacement. I explain code to it (rubber duck style), question its approach, and force myself to predict what might break before testing. These small adjustments make me engage my brain while still getting the productivity boost.

### Longer version:
This resonates hard. I've been daily-driving AI coding tools for about the same time, and that productivity vs. skill atrophy balance is a constant struggle.

What's worked for me is shifting how I think about these tools - from "do my job" to "pair program with me." Small changes in workflow make a huge difference:

1. I explain code to the AI before asking it to modify it (classic rubber duck debugging). This forces me to understand what I'm working with.

2. I routinely question the AI's approach and ask for alternatives. Even if I go with its first solution, just considering different options keeps my brain engaged.

3. When the AI offers a solution, I force myself to predict what might break before testing. This builds a mental model of the code's behavior.

4. I keep a personal "from scratch" project where I deliberately avoid using AI except for very specific questions. It's like going to the gym for coding muscles.

The sweet spot seems to be using AI for the tedious parts (boilerplate, standard patterns, formatting) while keeping your brain engaged in the architectural and problem-solving aspects.

I think we're in that awkward middle phase where AI is good enough to handle a lot of coding tasks, but not good enough to reliably handle debugging and maintenance. So we take the productivity boost on the front end but pay for it on the back end with debugging time.

I've found setting clear boundaries helps - "I'll use AI for this task but not for that one" - rather than just defaulting to "let me ask the AI" for everything.
