*   **Comment Text:** "I\u2019ve been using Cline for this. Love it. Used with claude3opus before, then 3.5 sonnet, then briefly 3.7 sonnet and now combination of deepseek v3 from March and mainly Gemini 2.5pro. It works very well although I\u2019ve not tried cursor so can\u2019t compare. I think there is also another extension based on cline that\u2019s supposed to have more features before they get to cline (forget the name now) but haven\u2019t felt the need to try that."

*   **Thread:** `1jpwx72` (What made You Choose Cline over Roo Code??)
*   **Link:** `https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jpwx72/what_made_you_choose_cline_over_roo_code/ml2plim/`
*   **Comment Text:** "Dunno how true this is, as I haven't really messed with Roo yet. But Roo is a fork of Cline, which is why theyre so similar. And from what I've gathered, Roo is more of the experimental option. Rolling out new features faster, but at the expense of stability. While Cline is slower to introduce new features, but tends to be a bit more stable and reliable."
