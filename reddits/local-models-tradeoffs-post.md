Title: Thinking of Running Local Models with Cline? Read This First!

Hey everyone,

We know lots of you are interested in running LLMs locally with Cline, often to save on API costs or for privacy reasons. That makes total sense! But before you dive in, we wanted to share some important context based on what we're seeing and the nature of how Cline works.

The TL;DR is this: while possible, running models locally comes with significant trade-offs, especially when it comes to Cline's core strength – reliable tool use.

Why the difference? Local models (like those run via Ollama or LM Studio) are usually heavily distilled versions of their cloud counterparts. Think of it like a compressed music file – you get the basic song, but lose a lot of the richness and detail. These local versions often retain only a small fraction (sometimes just 1-5%) of the original model's capacity. This directly impacts their ability to handle complex reasoning, multi-step tasks, and crucially, using tools like file editing, terminal commands, or browser automation effectively.

What does this mean in practice with Cline?

*   Performance: Expect things to be slower (5-10x) than cloud APIs, and be ready for your computer's resources (CPU, GPU, RAM) to be heavily taxed. You'll need decent hardware (think modern GPU w/ 8GB+ VRAM, 32GB+ RAM, SSD) just to get started, and even then, you're running the less capable versions.
*   Tool Reliability: This is the biggest one. Because local models are less capable, they struggle much more with Cline's tools. You'll likely see more failures in code analysis, file operations, terminal commands, etc. Complex, multi-step tasks are particularly prone to breaking down.

Our Recommendation:

*   Use Cloud Models (via API): For complex development, critical code changes, multi-step tasks, or anytime you need reliable tool use. This is where Cline truly shines.
*   Use Local Models: For simpler tasks like basic code completion, documentation generation, learning/experimentation, or when privacy is the absolute top priority and you accept the limitations.

If you do go local:

*   Start with smaller models.
*   Keep your prompts and tasks simple.
*   Save your work often!
*   Be prepared for tools to fail and potentially switch to a cloud model for more complex parts.
*   Watch out for common issues like "Tool execution failed" (model couldn't handle it) or connection errors (make sure your local server like Ollama is running and configured correctly in Cline).

Local models are constantly improving, which is exciting! But for now, they aren't a direct replacement for the power and reliability you get from cloud APIs when using a tool-heavy agent like Cline.

We want you to have the best experience possible, and that means understanding these trade-offs.
