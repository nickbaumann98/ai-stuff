**Title:** Generate UI Components Instantly with Cline + 21st.dev Magic UI

Hey folks,

We've been seeing more devs using Cline combine it with the 21st.dev Magic UI MCP server, and it's a pretty cool workflow for frontend, especially if you're tired of rebuilding the same UI components.

If you're tired of building the same UI components (navbars, cards, forms...) from scratch, this MCP is a lifesaver. Instead of having Cline *generate* UI code (which can be flaky), Magic UI connects to 21st.dev's library of pre-built, production-ready components.

You just describe the component you need in plain English:

`/ui responsive navbar with logo and dark mode toggle`

Or get more specific:

`/21 pricing card with gradient background and hover animation`

Cline uses the MCP to grab the corresponding component code from 21st.dev's library and implements it directly in your project. It's a huge time saver because you're getting reliable, tested code, not something hallucinated that needs hours of debugging.

It's a great example of how you can plug specialized tools (via MCP servers) right into your Cline workflow to speed up repetitive tasks.

Anyone else using Cline with MCP servers like this for UI generation or other specialized tasks? Curious to hear about other cool workflows.
