**Title:** It's Finally Here: Manage Your Supabase Database Directly From Cline!

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

Big news for Cline users who work with Supabase! The official Supabase MCP Server is now live in the Cline MCP Marketplace. We know many of you have been asking for this, and it's a pretty significant step – it's the first time a major database like Supabase gets full read *and* write access directly within an AI assistant like Cline via an official MCP server.

What does this mean? Less context switching. You can now ask Cline to interact with your Supabase database – run SQL queries, manage schemas, fetch config, etc. – right from your editor.

(Maybe insert supabase-execute-sql.mp4 here if Reddit allows videos easily, or link to it)
Imagine asking Cline: "Fetch the email addresses of users who signed up this week" or "Update the status for order ID 123," and watching it happen.

**How it Works & Getting Started**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the magic behind this, acting as a standard bridge allowing Cline to use external tools securely. The Supabase MCP server provides over 20 specific tools for database interaction.

Setup is quick:

1.  **Get a Supabase PAT:** You need a Personal Access Token from Supabase for authentication. Generate one here: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2.  **Install via Cline Marketplace:** Go to Extensions -> Cline -> MCP Marketplace in VS Code/Cursor. Find the Supabase server and click "Install".
3.  **Enter PAT:** Cline will securely prompt you for the PAT during installation.

That's it!

**What Can Cline Do Now with Supabase?**

Here are some key things you can ask Cline to do:

*   **Run SQL Directly:** Use the `execute_sql` tool for quick `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations. Super handy for quick checks or changes.
    (Consider linking supabase-execute-sql.mp4 here)

*   **Manage Schema with Migrations:** Ask Cline to create or alter tables, or even define entire schemas. It uses the `apply_migration` tool, so your changes stay tracked.
    (Consider linking supabase-create-table.mp4, supabase-edit-table.mp4, supabase-create-schema.mp4 here)

*   **Fetch Config:** Need your project URL or anon key? Use `get_project_url` and `get_anon_key`.

*   **Generate Types:** Keep your frontend types synced with `generate_typescript_types`.

*   **Debug:** Pull recent logs with `get_logs`.

*   **Database Branching (Experimental):** Play with Supabase's branching features (`create_branch`, `list_branches`, `merge_branch`).

This should seriously streamline workflows for anyone using Cline and Supabase together.

**Try it Out!**

Ready to ditch the tab-switching?

1.  Make sure you have Cline installed.
2.  Install the Supabase MCP Server from the Marketplace.
3.  Start asking Cline to interact with your Supabase project!

We're really excited about this and think it points towards a future where interacting with backends is much more conversational. Developers have been asking for this level of integration, and we're thrilled this official server is now available.

Let us know what you think, what you build, or if you run into any issues! You can share feedback here, in the Cline Discord (Link to Discord), or on the GitHub repo (https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp/issues).
