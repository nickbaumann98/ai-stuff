**Title:** Cline v3.9.0 Released: Gemini 1.5 Pro Support, Easier Local MCP Config & Fixes

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

Just pushed Cline v3.9.0! This update brings Google's powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro model into the mix, makes managing local MCP servers simpler, and includes a few key fixes.

**What's New:**

*   **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro Support:** You can now use Gemini 1.5 Pro Preview (03-25 model) directly in Cline. Just add your Google AI Studio API key in the provider settings to access its advanced coding and large context capabilities.
*   **Local MCP Server Configuration Tab:** We've added a dedicated tab in settings to configure and manage your local MCP servers more easily. Should streamline adding your own custom tools! (Might share a quick demo video later).
*   **LiteLLM Extended Thinking:** Added support for extended thinking when using the LiteLLM provider. (Thanks @jorgegarciarey!)

**Fixes:**

*   Improved token counting/context management for the DeepSeek provider.
*   Fixed occasional hangs with checkpoints.

Update your Cline extension to get the latest features. Let us know what you think!
