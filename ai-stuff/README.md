# AI-Generated Podcast Series from a PDF

This repository contains a 10-part podcast series that was generated entirely through an AI-powered workflow using Cline. The project started with a single PDF document, "Top 50 Large Language Model (LLM) Interview Questions," and was transformed into a full audio series.

## The Workflow

The entire process was orchestrated by Cline, using a combination of large language models and specialized tools:

1.  **Content Ingestion & Structuring:** Cline used **Gemini 2.5 Pro** to read and understand the source PDF. It then restructured the content into a coherent 10-part lecture series, generating a script for each episode.
2.  **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Each script was then converted into high-quality audio using the **ElevenLabs MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**, all from within the Cline environment.
3.  **File Organization:** Cline managed the entire file structure, creating directories for the source material, the generated transcripts, and the final audio files.

This project serves as a powerful example of how modern AI tools can be orchestrated to automate complex content creation and repurposing tasks.
