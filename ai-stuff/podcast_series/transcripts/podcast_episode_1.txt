**AI Lecture Series - Part 1: The Building Blocks of LLMs**

Welcome to this lecture series on Large Language Models. Today, in our first session, we'll explore the fundamental building blocks of LLMs, covering the first ten key questions in the field.

First, let's address a core concept: **tokenization**. What is it, and why is it so critical for LLMs? Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters. For instance, the word "artificial" might be split into "art," "ific," and "ial." This is vital because LLMs operate on numerical representations of these tokens, not raw text. This process enables models to handle diverse languages, manage unknown words, and optimize their vocabulary size, which enhances both computational efficiency and overall performance.

Next, we'll discuss the **attention mechanism** in transformer models. The attention mechanism allows an LLM to weigh the importance of different tokens within a sequence. It computes similarity scores to focus on the most relevant parts of the text. In the sentence, "The cat chased the mouse," attention helps the model link "mouse" directly to "chased." This ability to understand context is what makes transformers so effective for complex language tasks.

This leads us to the concept of the **context window**. The context window is the number of tokens an LLM can process at one time; it's essentially the model's working memory. A larger window, for example, 32,000 tokens, allows the model to consider more context, which is crucial for tasks like summarizing a long article. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational demand, so there's a trade-off between context size and efficiency.

Now, let's turn to fine-tuning, specifically the difference between **LoRA and QLoRA**. LoRA, or Low-Rank Adaptation, is a method that makes fine-tuning more efficient by adding small, low-rank matrices to a model's layers instead of retraining everything. This significantly reduces memory overhead. QLoRA extends this by applying quantization, such as using 4-bit precision, to further decrease memory usage while maintaining high accuracy. Thanks to QLoRA, it's possible to fine-tune a 70-billion-parameter model on a single GPU.

This concludes our first session on the building blocks of LLMs. In our next lecture, we will continue our exploration of these foundational concepts.
