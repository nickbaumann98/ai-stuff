**AI Lecture Series - Part 7: Advanced Architectures and Prompting**

Welcome to the seventh part of our lecture series. Today, we'll explore some of the more advanced concepts in LLM architecture, as well as sophisticated prompting techniques that unlock new capabilities. We'll be covering questions 31 through 35.

First, let's revisit a fundamental concept in calculus: the **chain rule**. The chain rule is used to compute the derivative of composite functions. In the context of LLMs, it is the engine behind backpropagation. It allows us to efficiently calculate the gradients layer by layer, from the output all the way back to the input, enabling the model to update its parameters and minimize loss across its deep architecture.

We've discussed attention scores before, but let's formalize how they are calculated in transformers. The formula is **Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((QK^T) / sqrt(d_k))V**. The scaled dot-product between the Query (Q) and Key (K) vectors measures token relevance. The softmax function then normalizes these scores to focus on the most important tokens, and the result is applied to the Value (V) vectors. This mechanism is what allows for such effective, context-aware generation.

Let's talk about a specific model: **Gemini**. How does it optimize multimodal LLM training? Gemini improves efficiency through a **unified architecture** that processes text and images together, which is more parameter-efficient. It also uses an **advanced attention mechanism** for more stable cross-modal learning and leverages **self-supervised techniques** to reduce the need for labeled data. These features make Gemini more scalable and stable than previous multimodal models like GPT-4.

The term **foundation model** is used frequently. What types of foundation models exist? They can be categorized broadly. We have **Language Models** like BERT and GPT-4 for text-based tasks. There are **Vision Models** like ResNet for image classification. We also have **Generative Models** like DALL-E for content creation, and **Multimodal Models** like CLIP that are designed for tasks involving both text and images.

We've touched on fine-tuning, but how does **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** help mitigate catastrophic forgetting? PEFT methods, such as LoRA, work by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters while freezing the rest. This preserves the vast knowledge gained during pretraining. By doing this, PEFT allows LLMs to adapt to new tasks without losing their core capabilities, ensuring robust performance across different domains.

This concludes our seventh lecture. In our next session, we will continue to explore advanced architectures and prompting techniques.
