**AI Lecture Series - Part 3: Training and Fine-Tuning**

Welcome back to our lecture series on Large Language Models. Today, we will delve into the critical processes of training and fine-tuning, covering questions 11 through 15.

Let's begin with a specific training objective: **next sentence prediction (NSP)**. NSP is a pretraining task where a model learns to determine if two sentences are consecutive or unrelated. Models like BERT were trained by classifying millions of sentence pairs as either sequential or random. This process improves the model's understanding of sentence relationships, which is crucial for tasks requiring coherence, such as dialogue systems or document summarization.

When generating text, there are different sampling strategies. Let's compare **top-k and top-p sampling**. Top-k sampling restricts the model's choices to the 'k' most probable next tokens. For example, if k=20, the model will only sample from the top 20 most likely words. Top-p, or nucleus sampling, is more adaptive. It selects from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a certain threshold 'p', like 0.95. Top-p is often more flexible, producing outputs that are both varied and coherent, making it ideal for creative writing.

A crucial aspect of working with LLMs is **prompt engineering**. This involves carefully designing the input prompt to guide the model toward the desired response. A clear prompt, such as "Summarize this article in 100 words," yields far better results than a vague one. Prompt engineering is especially powerful in zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios, where it allows LLMs to perform tasks like translation or classification without needing extensive, task-specific fine-tuning.

A significant challenge in fine-tuning is **catastrophic forgetting**, where a model forgets its prior knowledge after being trained on a new task. There are several strategies to mitigate this. One is **rehearsal**, which involves mixing old and new data during training. Another is **Elastic Weight Consolidation**, which protects critical weights to preserve existing knowledge. Finally, **modular architectures** add task-specific modules instead of overwriting the core model. These methods help LLMs retain their versatility across multiple tasks.

To make large models more practical, we use **model distillation**. This technique involves training a smaller "student" model to replicate the outputs of a larger "teacher" model. The student learns from the teacher's soft probabilities rather than just the final hard labels. This process significantly reduces the memory and computational power needed, allowing powerful models to be deployed on devices like smartphones for real-time applications.

This concludes our third session. In our next lecture, we will continue our discussion on training and fine-tuning.
