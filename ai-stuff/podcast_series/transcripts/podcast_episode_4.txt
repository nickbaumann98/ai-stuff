**AI Lecture Series - Part 4: Training and Fine-Tuning (Continued)**

Welcome back. In this lecture, we will continue our discussion of the practical aspects of training and fine-tuning Large Language Models, covering questions 16 through 20.

First, how do LLMs handle words they've never seen before, known as **out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words**? They use subword tokenization methods like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). BPE breaks down OOV words into known subword units. For example, "cryptocurrency" might be split into "crypto" and "currency." This allows the model to process and understand rare or new words, ensuring robust language comprehension.

Transformers represent a major leap forward from older architectures. How do they improve on **traditional Seq2Seq models**? Transformers have three key advantages: they can process tokens in **parallel** thanks to self-attention, unlike the sequential nature of RNNs; they can capture **long-range dependencies** between distant tokens; and they use **positional encodings** to preserve the order of the sequence. These features lead to superior scalability and performance.

A common problem in machine learning is **overfitting**, where a model memorizes the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. To mitigate this in LLMs, we use techniques like **regularization** (L1/L2 penalties), which simplifies the model; **dropout**, which randomly disables neurons during training to prevent over-reliance on any single one; and **early stopping**, which halts training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving.

In NLP, we often distinguish between **generative and discriminative models**. Generative models, like GPT, learn the joint probability of data to create new content, such as text or images. Discriminative models, like BERT when used for classification, learn the conditional probability to distinguish between different classes, such as in sentiment analysis. Generative models excel at creation, while discriminative models are focused on accurate classification.

Finally, let's compare two giants in the field: **GPT-4 and GPT-3**. GPT-4 offers several major improvements over its predecessor. It accepts **multimodal input**, meaning it can process both text and images. It has a much **larger context window**, handling up to 25,000 tokens compared to GPT-3's 4,096. And it demonstrates **enhanced accuracy**, with fewer factual errors due to more advanced fine-tuning. These advancements expand its applications to areas like visual question answering and highly complex dialogues.

This concludes our fourth lecture. Join us next time as we explore the magic of the attention mechanism in greater detail.
