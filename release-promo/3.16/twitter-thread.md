â†’ WORKFLOWS â†’

& more, all new in Cline v3.16!

Here's what we've got for ya ðŸ§µ

So, what are Workflows?

Think of them as your personal automation scripts. You define a sequence of actions â€“ using CLI commands, Cline's own tools (like read_file or ask_followup_question), or even MCPs â€“ all within a simple Markdown (.md) file.

Once defined, you trigger the entire workflow with its filename, like /[your-workflow-name.md]. Complex processes, like the PR review shown below, become one-shot commands.

Here's that PR Review workflow in action:
