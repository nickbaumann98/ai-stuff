v3.16 @everyone

[VIDEO: See Workflows automate a PR Review! (link to video)]

*   **Workflows**: Automate complex, multi-step tasks with simple `.md` files! Define sequences of CLI commands, Cline tools, and MCPs, then trigger them with a `/[workflow-name.md]` slash command (using the exact filename). Huge time saver for repetitive processes. Your imagination is the limit!
*   **Collapsible Recent Task List**: Keep your screen share private. (Thanks @cosmix!)
*   **Enable Auto-Approve Toggle**: Easily turn auto-approve on/off without losing your action settings.
*   **Improved Gemini Retry Handling**: Better UI feedback and progress indication for Gemini API request retries.
*   **Global Endpoint for Vertex AI**: Higher availability and fewer 429 errors for Vertex AI users. (Thanks @soniqua!)
*   **Settings Organization**: VSCode Advanced settings have been migrated to the Settings Webview for a cleaner layout.
*   **Fixes**: Addressed a memory leak that could occur during long sessions, an eternal loading state issue (Thanks @BarreiroT!), and improved quick actions functionality in auto-approve settings.

**Update now** via VS Code Marketplace, Cursor, or Windsurf!
