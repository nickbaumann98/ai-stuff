Stop the daily grind. Are repetitive dev tasks draining your energy and your time?

**Workflows in Cline v3.16 are here to change how you work.**

Imagine automating complex sequences – PR reviews, new project setups, your unique release processes – with a SINGLE command. That's Workflows.

Build your personal automation scripts with simple `.md` files. Combine CLI commands, Cline's built-in tools, even MCPs, like powerful LEGO blocks.

This isn't just scripting; it's intelligent automation, tailored by you, for your specific needs.
The time saving is real. The possibilities are truly endless.
