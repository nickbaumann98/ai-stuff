So, what are Workflows? They're your custom automation scripts, written in simple Markdown files (.md) and stored right in your project.

Create them via the new "Workflows" tab in Cline, then invoke any workflow using its filename, like /[workflow-name.md].

The real magic of Workflows is their composability. Think of them as LEGO blocks for your development process.

You can combine:
- CLI commands (like gh, docker)
- Cline's built-in tools (read_file, ask_followup_question)
- Even external MCP tool calls!
Our PR Review demo workflow showcases this by using the gh CLI alongside Cline's capabilities.

How do you spot a task perfect for a Workflow? Ask yourself: "Do I often do X, then Y, then Z?"

If you can describe a sequence, it’s a prime candidate. Start with something small that bugs you, turn it into a workflow, and refine it. You'll be amazed at what you can automate.

The possibilities are vast. Think about automating:
- Release processes: grabbing PRs, building changelogs, version bumps.
- New project setups: folder structures, dependency installs, config files.
- Custom reports: gathering stats, formatting data.

Truly, your imagination is the limit for streamlining your daily tasks.
