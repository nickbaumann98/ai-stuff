v3.17.9 @everyone

*   **Experimental Claude 4 Support:** Fixed edit failures and reliability issues with Claude 4 through improved delimiter handling (- and + instead of < and >). Much better success rate in testing! (Thanks heguro! 🙏)
*   **Task Timeline Scrolling:** Click any point in your task timeline to jump directly to that moment in the conversation
*   **CSV/XLSX File Support:** Drag and drop spreadsheets directly into Cline for data analysis and processing
*   **New Grok-3 Models:** Added grok-3, grok-3-fast, grok-3-mini, grok-3-mini-fast from xAI (Thanks PeterDaveHello! 🙏)
*   **Fixes:** AWS Bedrock credential caching, search tool output limits, checkpoint functionality, improved chat box UI (Thanks DaveFres! 🙏)

Since Claude 4 improvements are experimental, we need community feedback! Test it on complex diff editing and let us know how it compares to Claude 3.7/Gemini 2.5 Pro.

**Update now** via VS Code/Cursor/Windsurf Marketplace!
