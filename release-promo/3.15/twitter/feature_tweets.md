**Tweet 2/3:**
The Task Timeline, built by community contributor eomcaleb, is a step towards our vision for future multi-agent visibility. As AI takes on more, seeing *how* it works is crucial. We even had internal discussions on the best way to achieve this transparency. [link-to-media showing presentation screenshot, optional]
