**v3.15.0** @everyone

Really excited to share this v3.15 release!

Here are the highlihts::
*   **Task Timeline Visualization:** Understand the story of your tasks with a visual storyboard in the task header! (Thanks eomcaleb! 🙏)
*   **Gemini Implicit Caching:** New Implicit Caching from Gemini vastly improves cost savings when using models like Gemini 2.5 Pro
*   **New Community Docs Platform:** Our docs are now open source on Mintlify and in our main repo -- this could be an easy first contribution to Cline!
*   **Non-Blocking UI:** Cline no longer steals focus while editing files, meaning you can start typing your next prompt or review other files during edits.
*   **Quote Messages:** Granularly reference previous messages as context in chat for clearer, more precise conversations.
*   **`/reportbug` Command:** Quickly report issues with context directly from Cline.
*   **Larger File Analysis:** Cline can now handle larger individual files with high-context models.
*   **Improved Terminal Stability:** Significant fixes to reduce terminal-related task lockouts.
*   **Simplified Home Header:** A cleaner, more streamlined look.
*   **Enhanced Copy Buttons:** More convenient copying from task headers, messages, and code blocks. (Thanks weshoke! 🙏)
*   **Favorite Tasks:** Mark tasks as favorites so you can go back to them easily (very useful for long-standing tasks where you use /smol).
*   **AI-Assisted Commit Messages:** Let Cline help draft your commit messages. (Thanks zapp88! 🙏)
*   **Support for Windsurf & Cursor Rules:** Improved integration for users of these.
*   **Updated Auto-Approve UI:** More intuitive, with an "Approve All Commands" button.
*   **Batch History Deletion:** Select and delete multiple tasks at once. (Thanks danix800! 🙏)
*   **Mistral Medium-3 Support:** Added this new model.
*   **Bedrock Model Updates:** Including new defaults. (Thanks Watany! 🙏)
*   **Fixes:** Addressed issues with Windows paths (Thanks DaveFres! 🙏), local dev syntax (Thanks DaveFres! 🙏), markdown copy (Thanks weshoke! 🙏), loading errors (Thanks WinterYukky! 🙏), and more. (Additional fixes thanks PeterDaveHello! 🙏)
