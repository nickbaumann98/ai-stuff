â†’ GLOBAL WORKFLOWS â†’

& more improvements in Cline v3.17!

Here's what's new ðŸ§µ




Global Workflows are here!

Your best workflows can now travel with you across all projects. Store them in ~/Documents/Cline/Workflows and they're available everywhere.

Local workflows still take precedence, so project-specific customizations remain intact.




What's new in 3.17:
- Global Workflows (share across all projects)
- Claude 4 support across all providers  
- Redesigned settings interface
- Nebius AI Studio integration
- Smart Act mode prompts
- MCP server fixes

Solid improvements across the board.




The settings page got a major redesign!

Now split into tabs for easier navigation. When you're managing multiple API keys, model selections, and MCP configurations, organization matters.

Thanks to Yellow Bat @dlab-anton and the Roo Team for this contribution!

Quality of life improvements:
- Smart Act mode prompts with hotkey suggestions
- Fixed MCP server configuration issues  
- AWS Bedrock environment variable fixes (thanks @DaveFres!)
- Requesty provider fixes
- All advanced settings now in the settings page

Small touches that make daily development smoother.




Also new: Nebius AI Studio integration!

Thanks to @Aktsvigun for adding another provider option to Cline's growing ecosystem.

More choice = more flexibility for your specific needs.
