**Title:** Cline 3.17: Global Workflows are here!

**Body:**

Just shipped v3.17 with the much-requested global workflows feature. Your best automation patterns can now travel with you across all projects.

Global workflows work exactly like local ones, but they're available everywhere:
- Store them in ~/Documents/Cline/Workflows
- Local workflows in .cline/workflows/ still take precedence
- No more copying workflow files between projects

This has been one of the top feature requests. Many of you have built sophisticated workflows for specific tasks -- API integration patterns, testing strategies, deployment sequences. Now these become part of your permanent toolkit.

What else is new in 3.17:
- Claude 4 support across all providers (Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI)
- Redesigned settings page with tabbed interface (thanks Yellow Bat @dlab-anton and Roo Team!)
- Nebius AI Studio integration (thanks @Aktsvigun!)
- Smart Act mode prompts with hotkey suggestions
- Fixed MCP server configuration bug
- AWS Bedrock environment variable handling improvements (thanks @DaveFres!)
- Various provider and stability fixes

Available now in VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf marketplaces.
