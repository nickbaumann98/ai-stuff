**v3.14.0** @everyone

This release brings significant improvements to Gemini caching, checkpoint flexibility, rule creation, and much more based on community feedback!

*   **Improved Gemini Caching & Transparency:** Refined caching logic for Gemini/Vertex, plus a new Cache UI for OpenRouter/Cline providers and enabled pricing calculations for better cost visibility.
*   **Enhanced Checkpoints:** Added more checkpoints across the task, including when switching from Plan to Act mode, allowing easier plan refinement.
*   **`/newrule` Slash Command:** Ask Cline to generate project standards (design system, conventions) based on your code using `/newrule`.
*   **LaTeX Rendering:** Full LaTeX rendering support in the chat interface.
*   **Copy Buttons:** Added to code and markdown blocks (Thanks @weshoke! 🙏).
*   **Improved Drag & Drop:** Drag files directly from your OS file explorer (Remember to hold Shift!).
*   **Batch History Deletion:** Select and delete multiple tasks from history (Thanks @danix800! 🙏).
*   **Custom Timeouts:** Configurable API request timeouts for OpenRouter/Cline & Ollama (Thanks @WingsDrafterwork! 🙏).
*   **Bedrock Updates:** Support for custom model IDs (Thanks @clicube! 🙏) & Amazon Titan Text Premier model (Thanks @watany! 🙏).
*   **Fixes:** Addressed issues with terminal commands, Windows paths (Thanks @DaveFres! 🙏), local dev syntax (Thanks @DaveFres! 🙏), git mentions, cost calculations (Thanks @BarreiroT! 🙏), and more.

Huge thanks to all community contributors! 🙏
