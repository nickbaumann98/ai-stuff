# Cline v3.14: Improved Gemini Caching, `/newrule` Command, Enhanced Checkpoints & Key Updates

We're excited to announce Cline v3.14, bringing significant improvements to Gemini caching and cost transparency, more flexible checkpoints, a new command for rule creation, LaTeX support, and a host of quality-of-life updates driven by community feedback.

Let's dive into the highlights:

## Improved Gemini Caching & Transparency

We know accurate cost tracking and efficient model usage are crucial. While Gemini's context caching offers potential savings, ensuring its effectiveness and providing clear visibility has been an ongoing effort.

v3.14 introduces several key improvements:

*   **More Robust Caching:** We've refined the caching logic for both the Gemini and Vertex providers for increased reliability and better cost savings.
*   **Cache UI (OpenRouter/Cline):** To improve transparency, we've added a **Cache UI** for the OpenRouter and built-in Cline providers. This gives you better visibility into when caching is active. `[VISUAL: Cache UI Screenshot]`
*   **Pricing Calculation Enabled:** Pricing calculations are now enabled for Gemini and Vertex providers, offering better cost estimates during usage.

## More Flexibility with Enhanced Checkpoints

Checkpoints are vital for managing complex tasks. We've added more checkpoints across the task workflow, allowing you to restore from more points than just file changes.

Most importantly, **a checkpoint is now created right after you approve a plan and switch from Plan to Act mode.** If the initial code generation isn't heading in the right direction, you can easily revert to the planning stage, make adjustments, and proceed without losing your work. This offers more granular control over the iteration process. `[VIDEO: Checkpoint Demo]`

> **Pro Tip:** Take advantage of the new Plan-to-Act checkpoint! Don't hesitate to revert if the first few code outputs aren't matching your vision. Refining the plan early is often faster than editing lots of generated code.

## Generate Project Standards with `/newrule`

Need to document your project's design system or coding conventions to ensure consistency? The new `/newrule` slash command lets Cline do the heavy lifting.

Simply ask Cline, like `/newrule create a rule that standardizes our design system`. Leveraging its understanding of your project's context (code structure, libraries, patterns), Cline will analyze the relevant files and generate a `.clinerules` file documenting those standards. This helps maintain consistency for future development or onboarding new team members. Cline will even create the `.clinerules` folder if needed. `[VIDEO: /newrule Demo]`

> **Pro Tip:** Use `/newrule` to ask Cline to document various project standards ‚Äì design system usage, API patterns, testing conventions, preferred refactoring techniques, tech stack summaries ‚Äì ensuring consistency across your codebase and team.

## LaTeX Rendering (v3.14 Special)

Coinciding with the v3.14 version number, we couldn't resist adding **full LaTeX rendering support.** Cline now correctly renders mathematical equations and other LaTeX markup directly in the chat. `[VISUAL: LaTeX Rendering Example]`

## Key Quality-of-Life Updates & Community Contributions

This release is packed with smaller but significant improvements:

*   **Improved Drag & Drop:** Drag files directly from your OS's file explorer (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.) into Cline. Just remember to **hold Shift** while dragging! Error handling for unsupported files is also improved. `[VISUAL: Drag & Drop Example]`
*   **Copy Buttons:** Added copy buttons to code blocks and markdown blocks for easier reuse. (Thanks **@weshoke** for the markdown button!) `[VISUAL: Copy Button Example]`
*   **Batch History Deletion:** Select and delete multiple tasks from your history at once. (Thanks **@danix800**!) `[VISUAL: Batch History Deletion Demo]`
*   **Custom Timeouts:** Configure API request timeouts for OpenRouter/Cline and Ollama providers in settings. (Thanks **@WingsDrafterwork**!) A separate terminal connection timeout setting is also available.
*   **Bedrock Updates:** Support for custom model IDs (thanks **@clicube**!) and the Amazon Titan Text Premier model (thanks **@watany**!).
*   **Truncation Notice:** Cline now explicitly notifies you when context is manually truncated.
*   **Task Header:** Expanded by default for easier visibility.
*   **Fixes Galore:** Addressed bugs related to terminal command race conditions, Windows path handling (thanks **@DaveFres**!), local development syntax errors (thanks **@DaveFres**!), git commit mentions, and cost calculations (thanks **@BarreiroT**!).

A huge thank you to all community contributors! üôè
