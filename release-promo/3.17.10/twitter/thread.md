Cline v3.17.10 is live with expanded model support, a new VSCode walkthrough, and key quality-of-life improvements! üßµ

We've added support for Qwen 3 series models with thinking mode options (Thanks @Jonny-china!). Plus, new AskSage models: Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude 4 Opus, GPT 4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Thanks @swhite24!).

Getting started with Cline is now easier than ever with our new VSCode walkthrough, guiding new users through the setup process.

We've also improved the Ollama model selection with a filterable dropdown instead of radio buttons, making it much smoother to find your preferred model (Thanks @paulgear!).

Other notable improvements include support for streamable MCP servers, a setting to disable aggressive terminal reuse (addressing task lockout issues), and a fix for the settings dialog applying changes even when canceled.

Huge thanks to our community contributors: @Jonny-china, @swhite24, and @paulgear for their valuable contributions! üôè

Update to v3.17.10 today and experience the latest enhancements!
