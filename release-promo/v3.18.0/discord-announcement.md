**v3.18** @everyone

*   **Gemini CLI Provider:** You can now use your local Gemini CLI to get 1,000 free daily requests for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash models. (Thanks @google-gemini! üôè)
*   **Claude 4 Optimizations:** We've significantly improved performance and reliability for all Claude 4 models. Diff edit failures in production are down from 10% to 6%, and we now recommend Claude 4 Sonnet as the default model.
*   **Fixes:** Resolved a race condition in Plan/Act mode and improved search/replace parsing.
