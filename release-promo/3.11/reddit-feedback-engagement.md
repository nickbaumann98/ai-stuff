**Title:** How’s Cline working for you lately?

We’ve shipped a lot of updates recently and are curious how things are feeling in your day-to-day workflow.

- What’s been surprisingly useful?
- Any rough edges or moments where Cline didn’t do what you expected?
- Got a story, a favorite trick, or a “wish it worked like this” moment?

We’re always looking to make Cline better, and real-world feedback (good or bad) is super valuable. Let us know how it’s going—let’s chat in the comments.
