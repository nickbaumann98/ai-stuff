**Title:** Cline v3.11 Release: Redesigned Checkpoints for Better Task Control

Hey everyone,

Cline v3.11 is here, bringing a significant improvement to how you can track and manage tasks: **Redesigned Checkpoints**.

**What's New with Checkpoints?**

We heard feedback about wanting more visibility and control during complex tasks. The new Checkpoints system aims to address that directly:

*   **More Frequent:** Checkpoints are now created after *every* action Cline takes (like running a command, editing a file, etc.), not just after file edits.
*   **Clearer UI:** They appear as subtle line indicators in the chat margin. Hover over them to see details about the action and when it happened.
*   **Better Control:** This granularity makes it much easier to understand exactly what Cline did at each step. If you realize you've gone down the wrong path or want to undo a specific action, you can revert to an earlier checkpoint with more precision, helping prevent context pollution and keeping your task on track.

Essentially, you now have finer-grained control over the task narrative as it unfolds.

**Other Updates in v3.11:**

*   **Grok 3 Support:** Added support for xAI's Grok 3 models via their provider integration.
*   **Improved Telemetry:** More robust error tracking for users who have opted into telemetry. Thank you for helping us catch bugs and make Cline better.

Let us know what you think of the new Checkpoints!
