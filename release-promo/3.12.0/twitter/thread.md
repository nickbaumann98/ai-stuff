Cline v3.12 is out, and it just got a lot faster ðŸ’¨

We've significantly boosted performance for applying diff edits, especially noticeable in large files -- making the editing process feel much faster. [VIDEO: Release Overview] [VISUAL: Diff Edit Animation Comparison]

2/
Editing should now feel much more responsive, letting you iterate faster.

We also added a small indicator in chat showing the number of edits Cline is making for better transparency.

3/
Quick access boost: You can now mark your favorite models in the Cline & OpenRouter providers.

Your top choices appear right at the top of the list. Less scrolling, more focus. [VISUAL: Favorite Model Toggle]

4/
More control over safety: New auto-approve settings let you specifically disable Cline's ability to read/edit files *outside* your current workspace, unless you explicitly approve.

5/
Also in v3.12:
- Streaming & reasoning effort support for Grok 3 Mini.
- Easier MCP server settings access.
- Ollama provider improvements (retries, timeouts, errors - thanks `suvarchal`!).
- Bug fixes for browser tool results, checkpoints & more.

6/
Cline v3.12 focuses on refining the core experience: faster edits, quicker model selection, and better control.

Update via VS Code Marketplace.
