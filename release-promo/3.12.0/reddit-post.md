**Title:** Cline v3.12 Released: Faster Diff Edits in Large Files, Model Favorites, New Controls & More!

Hey everyone, Nick from Cline here.

Just pushed out Cline v3.12, bringing some nice improvements based on your feedback!

**Highlights:**

*   **Faster Diff Edits (Especially in Large Files):** We heard the feedback about sluggishness when applying lots of edits in big files. v3.12 significantly improves performance here, making the process feel much smoother and more responsive. No more frustrating lag! We also added a small indicator in chat showing the number of edits being applied. [VISUAL: Diff Edit Animation Comparison]
*   **Model Favorites:** Using Cline or OpenRouter providers? You can now mark your go-to models as favorites for quick access at the top of the list. Less scrolling, more coding. [VISUAL: Favorite Model Toggle]
*   **New Auto-Approve Options:** Added more granular control â€“ you can now specifically disable auto-approval for file reads/edits *outside* your current workspace for extra safety.
*   **Grok 3 Mini Support:** Added streaming and "reasoning effort" support.
*   **Easier MCP Management:** Quick settings access button in the MCP popover.
*   **Ollama Improvements:** Better retries, timeouts, and error handling (thanks `suvarchal`!).
*   **Bug Fixes:** Squashed bugs related to the browser tool results, checkpoint popover behavior, and duplicate checkpoints.

The main goal with 3.12 was refining the core experience -- faster edits, quicker model selection, and better control.
